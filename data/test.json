    "That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ?",
    "But it will be expensive to have a car in the city , won't it ?",
    "You didn't ring me last night . You said you would .",
    "how dare you !",
    "They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !",
    "I tell you I must go !",
    "Oh , you men ! You're all the same .",
    "I envy her and also I hate her at the same time .",
    "Thanks . Sometimes talking with a friend is a great way to get over something . Do you mind if I vent a little bit ?",
    "Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?",
    "I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking .",
    "I know . I still haven't heard from her . The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around .",
    "Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day .",
    "At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ?",
    "Is there a reason why you're trying to get off the phone so fast ?",
    "You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .",
    "I know . I still haven ' t heard from her . The good thing is that I ' m so angry with her that I don ' t feel sad about not having her around .",
    "It was a few things . The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary , but she stood me up !",
    "I can't stand being with you any more . I'm sick of your drinking .",
    "What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck !",
    "It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !",
    "They both just talk about how great they are all the time .",
    "Well , no . it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?",
    "Yes , but I bet $ 200 dollars on the Cougars !",
    "I don ' t understand how you can have any sympathy for show biz stars . They ' re overpaid , over-ambitious , and over-adored .",
    "You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people .",
    "He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .",
    "It ' s the worst thing I ' Ve ever tried .",
    "If I remember , he got off with a light sentence . Something like three years in a minimum-security prison .",
    "That's true . Her husband is a fat cat .",
    "I don ' t think I can take another semester of this dorm food .",
    "Maybe it is . But it ' s out of fashion .",
    "I wasn't happy with it .",
    "I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .",
    "I hate it .",
    "That ' s the kind of thing in America that gets me mad . Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail .",
    "I ' m not crazy about it at all .",
    "You are being watched ! Be careful Dan ! Be careful !",
    "He followed me all the way home !",
    "Dad , I'm scared .",
    "I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",
    "This is my house . Let me show you around it .",
    "Thank you . I couldn ' t have done it without the help of a strong team .",
    "Yes , the weather sure is nice today .",
    "I can hardly wait !",
    "Yes , please . Thank you for everything .",
    "Let me enjoy it .",
    "Oh , I like it . It's such a beautiful dance , but I can't do it well . What about you ?",
    "Yes . Look ! Mary is going to throw the bride bouquet .",
    "Yeah , I ' ll try to do the same . So , I was wondering you wanna go out to dinner Friday night ?",
    "Yes , it's really savory .",
    "Yes ! We have all assumed that you were the quiet , shy type .",
    "Sure . Let me just grab my wallet . You certainly do look happy this morning .",
    "I find the Chinese dishes wonderful .",
    "You were doing great out there !",
    "Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful .",
    "Very good . That may be the most delicious food I have ever eaten .",
    "Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it .",
    "I haven't read a book like that for as long as I can remember .",
    "I requested it . What do you say ? Do you have your dancing shoes on ?",
    "Ok . See you later .",
    "And I was glad to receive your letter .",
    "Yes . It ' s easy and convenient to use a computer . But it takes a long time to really master it .",
    "I'm so happy . Even though we are both working , we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends .",
    "Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl .",
    "How do you do , Mr . Wu ? Welcome .",
    "My love will grow , like a river to flow .",
    "Haha , so you are my E-bf .",
    "A couple of times .",
    "Good idea ! I've always been interested in that . How much is the entrance fee ?",
    "would you mind if I helped out in the kitchen instead ? I do enjoy cooking .",
    "Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ?",
    "It's super .",
    "Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .",
    "The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone .",
    "Yeah , why not ? We haven't been out for dinner for quite a long time . A new French restaurant has just opened in our neighborhood . We can go there .",
    "Do you like western music ?",
    "Merry Christmas , Lily .",
    "I ' d love to but I ' m afraid I can ' t . I ' Ve already got a lunch engagement .",
    "Thank you .",
    "Absolutely . That's why when he entered the finale , I was so excited .",
    "Hi ! Is that the new laptop you brought last week ? It looks very nice .",
    "Hi , Mike , what gives ?",
    "There you can see british leaders , entertainers , criminals , and royalty .",
    "I believe it . Hoo , this car corners like it's on rails .",
    "Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off .",
    "Honey , how about taking them to the beach this weekend ?",
    "You bet . Now that you mentioned it , I think I'll call her now and see if she is available tonight .",
    "Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .",
    "It's a fine day today , isn't it ?",
    "That's great . Well , we'd better get back to our seats . It's about to start .",
    "Thanks . Miss Zhang .",
    "I'm not sure . I guess I'll just stay at home . Maybe I'll catch up on my reading . What about you ? Any plans ?",
    "Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ?",
    "A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets !",
    "Looks like we both float back and forth . I'm baritone .",
    "What's that ?",
    "I am all set . He can come anytime .",
    "Not bad thanks .",
    "You're telling me ! There are thousands of people here .",
    "Guess !",
    "Nice meeting you , too .",
    "In college . But I don't dance very often . What's your favourite dance ?",
    "I ' m glad you ' re enjoying it .",
    "It's just what I wanted .",
    "Where is it ?",
    "Goodbye .",
    "Oh yeah , I saw the tea house the other day . I think I might go and have a look sometime . It's a nice neighborhood here .",
    "Cheer !",
    "Perfect ! I like this one .",
    "Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy .",
    "Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know .",
    "Do you feel like going to see a movie tonight ?",
    "Quite well , thank you .",
    "There's a gym nearby ? That's exciting ! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible . I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight .",
    "Yes , both . Last trip I fished a little and hiked five miles .",
    "Well , yes . Several colleagues from different departments helped me with that . They are very supportive . I consulted an economic expert last week . He was very kind to give valuable suggestions .",
    "How happy you are ! Next Monday is your wedding day . Congratulations !",
    "fine . I'll go vacuum . Let me know if you need any other help .",
    "I'm going to take more pictures today .",
    "Well , I like collecting matchbox ! I'm not sure if that counts , though .",
    "that's a good idea . When did you buy it ? Is it a name brand ?",
    "I'm serious .",
    "Very good . But you should talk about your family , too .",
    "Let me show you the way . Please follow me .",
    "Do you feel like going to see Paul and Claire tonight ?",
    "Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries .",
    "Thank you .",
    "Thank you . Wow , your school has so many honors . Congratulations !",
    "Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ?",
    "Great .",
    "Good for you ! Have you seen Kelly recently ? Is she still dating nick ?",
    "Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work !",
    "Of course . Here is the fitting room .",
    "Okay .",
    "Right , congratulations .",
    "It certainly has been a pleasure seeing you again and renewing old memories .",
    "Fortunately , there is no person died .",
    "Don't hurry . Wait for my call .",
    "Wow , that does sound like it's going to be fun .",
    "My feelings exactly .",
    "Mmm ... Well we could go to that new art gallery instead .",
    "That was a great dinner . I didn't know that you knew how yo cook .",
    "Hi , dear , I've got your voice at last .",
    "I'm pretty good . Thanks for asking .",
    "Certainly it is . It's worth an Academy Award .",
    "Yes . Especially in autumn , the red leaves of the maple trees make the whole mountain red .",
    "Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind .",
    "It's my pleasure .",
    "I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball .",
    "As long as it doesn't snow !",
    "Oh , yes . I ' d love to .",
    "I've had a great time and thank you for your spending so much time showing me around .",
    "We should hang out some time .",
    "Oh , thank you ! It's very kind of you . Ah , it is a porcelain vase .",
    "I am sorry for that . I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery .",
    "You're right . Most of their dishes have sweet sauces . We could try that Indian restaurant just down the road from us .",
    "Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors .",
    "I really appreciated it .",
    "Oh , yeah . OK . I'll just buy smallthings !",
    "I'm glad that you think so . I thought it might be a bit too revealing .",
    "It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose .",
    "I do like Thai food . Did you see much of Bangkok ?",
    "How about taking a walk in the park ?",
    "I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch .",
    "Of course , I will . Well , it's time for me to say goodbye . The plane will take off soon . Hope some day you will come to America for a visit .",
    "Lucy , come here ! I can see the lake which is in the center of park .",
    "It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ?",
    "Ron , have a seat and I'll get us something to drink .",
    "Thank you , Li Mei . Come into the dining room . I'm going to cut the cake soon .",
    "You big scrooge !",
    "Happy birthday , Ms . Lin . Here is a present for you .",
    "My pleasure , Mr . Green . I look forward to an excellent relationship with your company .",
    "Look at the museum guide . It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide .",
    "We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !",
    "that's a good idea . Let's discuss after work .",
    "don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .",
    "It ' s a great car . It ' s very comfortable and it goes really fast .",
    "I'm all set . Thank you for the dinner , Jack .",
    "Oh my gosh , how exciting !",
    "Well , you can't compare a small balcony to this large veranda . This is perfect for having a barbecue in summer .",
    "They're probably going to be so happy .",
    "OK , well , let me just get my coat and we'll go to the diner around the corner .",
    "Good idea !",
    "Yes . I like it very much .",
    "A little , but the rush was worth it .",
    "OK . Do you want us to bring something ?",
    "Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world .",
    "Rose , the weekend is coming . Let's discuss what we will do .",
    "Let's get all the balls out of the pockets .",
    "Hi , I'm Lucas , I just moved in next door .",
    "Ahahah , and I thought you were tired .",
    "Come here ! I can see the tall camphor trees from here .",
    "Fine . See you later .",
    "Glad to meet you , too .",
    "So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ' t been to one for ages .",
    "That ' s very kind of you . But if I don ' t go now I ' ll miss the last bus .",
    "OK . I'll wait here for you .",
    "That's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day .",
    "Good morning , Mary !",
    "Cheers .",
    "I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .",
    "Hey Ted , I saw this ad in the paper . You should take a look .",
    "Yes . to our first anniversary and many more to come . Cheers !",
    "The gown is quite expensive , believe me .",
    "What are those ?",
    "Hop in , I'll give you a ride .",
    "I'm glad you like it .",
    "You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her .",
    "Ashley , what a great dinner party !",
    "Aha , Aha ...",
    "I like to play the piano for fun .",
    "Yeah , that would let us know what would work best .",
    "Hi , Lucy !",
    "What things make you excited ?",
    "OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .",
    "OK . Then I'll be expecting you .",
    "Brazil calls for a time out and we ' ll be right back , after a short commercial break .",
    "Thanks . I'm flattered .",
    "I passed history test .",
    "OK , will do !",
    "Good ! I'm interested in your advice .",
    "I'm really looking forward to reading your column .",
    "Thank you . Do you need something else ?",
    "There are three of them , the Three Tenors .",
    "I can't stand making decisions . You choose !",
    "That would be fine . Where are you going ?",
    "Certainly . I'll be glad to .",
    "Yeah . She's a healthy beautiful girl .",
    "Good ! I am really thirsty . You know it really is hot outside !",
    "Yes , it suits you very well . It certainly is unique . I don ' t think I ' Ve seen anything like it before .",
    "Yes . It says it will be sunny all day . No sign of rain at all .",
    "We are on the high way . Find the pound shade ..",
    "How nice seeing the sun back again ! The air is so fresh .",
    "maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha .",
    "Relax , it was just a goat !",
    "First of all , it ' s absolutely gorgeous .",
    "He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon !",
    "Hello , Tom . How do you find the dinner of yesterday ?",
    "She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting .",
    "I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .",
    "I know , fresh fruit flavored is the best ever .",
    "Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair .",
    "Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !",
    "Would you be interested in joining me ?",
    "That would be wonderful . Thanks !",

    "Thank you .",
    "That's a good idea .",
    "OK . I'll take it .",
    "I'd like to , where ?",
    "What a great idea !",
    "Oh , Jack , you deserve it . You ' Ve been working so hard .",
    "Mary , this is Mr . Wu , my new Chinese friend .",
    "OH , This is the famous Emperor Palace building .",
    "Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited !",
    "Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things .",
    "How about dinner tonight ? My treat .",
    "ok , got it . I ' ll call you sometime next week .",
    "Great ! I would like to see cute pandas , too .",
    "It is my pleasure to see you off .",
    "The same to you .",
    "Right , thanks .",
    "Let me show you the way . Please follow me .",
    "Thank you , David .",
    "It's almost time to get aboard .",
    "It sounds like this is going to be authentic Mexican food .",
    "Happy birthday , George . Many happy returns of the day . Here's a present for you .",
    "You dance beautifully too .",
    "Great . I got to try so many things for the first time .",
    "Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music .",
    "Oh , I think I know the place you mean . We ate there last month , right ?",
    "I believe most of them think it as good public relations . They can promote their product and make their company better-known .",
    "Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in .",
    "Great idea . I ' m looking forward to it . See you then .",
    "Then I'll see you in the parking lot at five ! Thank you !",
    "Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck .",
    "No , thanks .",
    "That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer .",
    "We'd like to . Can you tell me when we go ?",
    "Me too . I feel very thirsty as well .",
    "Oh , Babe , I can ' t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ' t wait for all the adventures we ' re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ' t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you .",
    "Happy anniversary , sweetheart !",
    "I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement .",
    "Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ?",
    "Of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .",
    "That's good to know . Oh , listen ! The band's playing our song .",
    "Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour .",
    "Surely I want . It's quite popular nowadays .",
    "That was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?",
    "I believe in that . Well , the performance is about to begin . Let's be quiet .",
    "Do you mean the red things ? They are roses .",
    "It ' s just the cows that are grazing over there . We can milk them later .",
    "OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ?",
    "It's a deal .",
    "I know . That ' s why I bought it . I hate wearing the same styles like everybody else is wearing .",
    "Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .",
    "Guess what ? I've got great news !",
    "Sound like everything is great .",
    "I think this color isn ' t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?",
    "He ' s really good looking , he ' s quite tall , around 6 ' 1 \" , he ' s in his early thirties , and he ' s got the most beautiful dark brown eyes ...",
    "That sounds like a good idea . The sky is clear , the sun is shining and there's a nice cool breeze , so it is not too hot .",
    "I know life is not all roses , and I believe I will pull this through .",
    "The same to me . All the things here make me happy , the mountain , the water , the grass , the birds , the sunshine ...",
    "How about taking a walk in the park ?",
    "A foot massage sounds like a great idea . They are very relaxing . I ' d also like to have a mudpack on my face . It ' s supposed to help with your complexion .",
    "Hobbies are great . I'm going to make a list of all the things I like to do .",
    "How about some fish ?",
    "Thank you for your compliments . It's just you are a good leader . Do you like the foxtrot and tango ?",
    "I'll get my things and meet you there .",
    "It's nice of you to see my off at the airport . Thank you very much .",
    "Good bye .",
    "Have a glass of wine , Mr . Wu ? And let me introduce you to some of my guests .",
    "Yes , and I took many pictures .",
    "OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first .",
    "Is it made of chocolate ?",
    "it looks great , but you need something to go with it . It's too plain on its own .",
    "Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .",
    "No . I haven ' t had the pleasure .",
    "Don't worry . It is a test of physical endurance , intelligence . Just to finish it is considered a victory for most .",
    "Yes , I finally have an inspiration .",
    "Excellent choice . Can I dish you up some chicken ?",
    "Good . Where shall we meet ?",
    "That Italian restaurant in the city centre always has large portions . Do you want to go there ?",
    "They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ?",
    "Yes , the weather sure is nice today .",
    "OK .",
    "Please bring me a cup of coffee .",
    "Maybe you won't believe this , but it was made by my grandmother .",
    "That's pretty good . Let's do it .",
    "I couldn't agree with you more .",
    "I hope you are Settling in at school !",
    "Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your new neighbor . My name is Andy .",
    "Fine , just fine . And you ?",
    "I enjoy camping .",
    "Thanks for the invitation . I will !",
    "Of course . Do you want to see it ?",
    "I appreciate what you have done for me . Everything I have seen here has left a deep impression on me . I really don't know how to express my thanks to you .",
    "I'd enjoy that .",
    "That sounds great . Is it casual ?",
    "Are you going to the movie theater with me tonight ?",
    "I really enjoyed that film ! What about you ?",
    "Oh , I'm glad .",
    "You know that everybody notices how beautiful you are , don't you ?",
    "Congratulations on your success .",
    "The band is pretty good . How do you like the music ?",
    "It doesn't matter .",
    "Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone !",
    "Mike's going to have a self-driving traveling across the country .",
    "Fred and David , my college class mates and Rachel .",
    "Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself .",
    "Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas .",
    "Yeah , I want the note .",
    "perfect !",
    "Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty .",
    "How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you !",
    "Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me .",
    "I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?",
    "Paul , what kind of music do you like to listen to ?",
    "It's been nice talking to you .",
    "I feel like going for a drink , it's been a long day .",
    "That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia .",
    "How about tango ?",
    "Yes . I thought it was excellent . Didn't you ?",
    "He's after your own heart , it is important .",
    "I'm very happy to meet you . You're from the United States , aren't you ?",
    "I won't argue with that ! Let's go !",
    "How is night life in Beijing ?",
    "OK , I'll talk to you soon .",
    "yes , I do . Let ' s go . We should be able to find something suitable . We should get him something old ... something historic .",
    "I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?",

    "What sort of clothes does he wear ?",
    "I don't understand .",

    "But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian",
    "Maybe . I don't know .",
    "That ' s probably because she wants you to read the book first .",
    "Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !",
    "What ' s the matter , Sally ? You look so unhappy .",
