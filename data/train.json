    "Mr . black has been getting a little around aside .",
    "I'm surprised . He does't look like a guy who'd ever cheat on his wife , does he ?",
    "No , he doesn't . But his wife found out he has been too charming for a long time . Incredibly , he has many different girlfriends . Starting almost right after they married 20 years ago .",
    "Well , I'm really surprised . You are not doing anything behind my back , are you ?",
    "No , the only thing I've ever done behind your back is zip you up , besides I told all my other girlfriends , and my wife who's getting suspicious . and we had a cold for a while , tell the",
    "Haha ... You are not very funny . I guess that means - - except me to tell my lover we have stoped seeing each other too .",

    "I'm so glad I bought this watch !",
    "Cool ! Flashy red lines !",
    "I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .",
    "Is it waterproof ?",
    "Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .",
    "Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?",
    "Well , surfing , scuba diving ...",
    "Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .",
    "Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you .",
    "What can I get you ?",
    "I'd love a gin and tonic .",
    "Can I help you , Ma'am ?",
    "I need a phone card for this new cell phone .",
    "Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ?",
    "It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student .",
    "Then the M-Zone will be suitable .",
    "What's special with the service ?",
    "You know students use tested message service . And they provide favorable service for that .",
    "That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card .",
    "Oh , there is a sales promotion for it now .",
    "Oh , good . Then what is it ?",
    "If you buy a pre-paid phone card worth 100 yuan today , you will get 50 yuan for free .",
    "May I have two of them ?",
    "Sure . As many as you want .",
    "Okay , then a third one for my husband too .",
    "Johnny , I can't believe you would do that .",
    "I know , Grandma , I just ...",
    "You're darn Toomin ' , you know ! Now , you're on housework duty while I'm here !",
    "Yes'm .",
    "You're going to mop the floor until you can see your face in it !",
    "Yes'm .",
    "And you're going to dust every piece of furniture in the house !",
    "Yes'm .",
    "It's time for desserts ! Are you still hungry ?",
    "I've always got room for something sweet !",
    "what are you going to try first ?",
    "I've never tried traditional Greek yogurt , so I want to try that first .",
    "do they serve the yogurt with anything ?",
    "I believe they add locally produced honey to it .",
    "that sounds good . I'm going to start with an Italian tiramisu .",
    "do you want to try some of my yogurt . It's a favorite everyday dessert in Greece .",
    "ok . Mmm .",
    "what do you think ? How does it taste ?",
    "it's nice , but it's rather plain . Do you want to try my tiramisu ?",
    "sure . I'll just have a bite .",
    "what do you think ? Does it taste good ?",
    "it's absolutely delicious ! That is the best tiramisu I've ever had !",
    "I'm glad you like it . I don't care for it . Why don't you finish my tiramisu so that I can try one of those fried bananas ?",
    "ok . I've had one of those before . They're really sweet and crunchy .",
    "do you know where they are from .",
    "I believe they are a local delicacy in the South .",
    "do you want me to get you one , too ?",
    "yeah , why not ? We've already pigged out as it is !",
    "ok , I'll be back with two fried bananas in a few minutes . Wait for me here !",
    "Yes , madam ? Can I help you ?",
    "Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?",
    "Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .",
    "I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .",
    "Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?",
    "Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?",
    "That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?",
    "Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .",
    "I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .",
    "I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .",
    "Well , it's all new stock in the window now .",
    "May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?",
    "Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .",
    "Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .",
    "Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .",
    "Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .",
    "That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for .",
    "There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .",
    "This Olympic park is so big !",
    "Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park .",
    "Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ?",
    "The whole stadium is to be finished this June .",
    "How many seats are there in the stand ?",
    "Oh , there are 5000 seats in total .",
    "I didn ' t know it would be so big !",
    "It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there .",
    "Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing .",
    "We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors .",
    "You won't believe what just happened .",
    "What ?",
    "I went down to change some money , right ?",
    "Yes . We need some . How much did you change ?",
    "I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate .",
    "Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ?",
    "Not today .",
    "What do you mean ?",
    "I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board . At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something .",
    "Why ?",
    "Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar .",
    "Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ?",
    "I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense .",
    "Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ?",
    "So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true . They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar .",
    "That's amazing ! Really ? How could it change so much in two days ?",
    "Wow , you ' re up early today ! What ' s for breakfast ?",
    "Well , I felt like baking , so I made some muffins .",
    "Smells good ! I ' ll make some coffee . Do you want me to make you some eggs ?",
    "Sure , I'll take mine , sunny side up .",
    "Www , I don ' t know how you can eat your eggs like that ! Ever since I was small , I ' Ve had eggs and soldiers .",
    "You know , my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for twenty years . It drove my mom crazy !",
    "You know what really drives me crazy ? When I ask for soft boiled eggs , and they overcook them , so they come out hard boiled ! How can you dipyour toast into a hard boiled egg ?",
    "You ' re so picky sometimes .",
    "Here you go , honey , fried eggs .",
    "Dammit ! I asked for sunny side up ! How many times do I have to tell you .",
    "Mary , it's good to see you !",
    "Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .",
    "I am so glad that you decided to stop by !",
    "Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .",
    "Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?",
    "Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .",
    "How about a little snack then ?",
    "No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .",
    "Well then , how is your family ?",
    "Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .",
    "Well , it was nice talking to you .",
    "It was nice talking to you too .",
    "We should really hang out again .",
    "That would be fun .",
    "Where do you want to go ?",
    "I think we should go out to eat .",
    "That sounds good .",
    "All right , so I'll see you then .",
    "I'll call you later .",
    "Okay , I'll talk to you later then .",
    "See you later .",
    "Bye .",
    "Do you know how late it is ?",
    "My fault . I didn't realize what time it was .",
    "I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook .",
    "Not really . I'm telling the truth .",
    "Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late ?",
    "This is true , but it must've slipped my mind .",
    "Regardless , all you had to do was give a call .",
    "I know . I should've called .",
    "Come home late one more time , and you'll find your stuff outside .",
    "You want to throw me out over this ?",
    "That's right , maybe then you'll respect my rules .",
    "That's fine , because if I leave , then your rules won't matter .",
    "Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line .",
    "You have much patience .",
    "Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !",
    "Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .",
    "What does it say ?",
    "This is an especially famous one . It says \" May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . \"",
    "That's very nice . Is it for sale ?",
    "No . I never sell my artwork .",
    "Really ? Then what do you do with it ?",
    "I give it away . Here , this one is for you .",
    "Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !",
    "Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...",
    "What do you think about this store ? I heard it ' s a posh store that ' s only got branches in big cities .",
    "I love this store . The only problem is that it ' s extremely expensive .",
    "Don ' t worry . I ' Ve decided that for your birthday I ' m going to take you shopping for a new dress .",
    "Really ? I thought you hated shopping ?",
    "I do , that ' s why you should appreciate this gift !",
    "Sure . That ' s really nice of you . Let ' s go in and try some things on .",
    "How about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .",
    "That ' s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?",
    "Here you go . On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ' s on special offer today .",
    "I think this color isn ' t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?",
    "Let me look . Let ' s see ... they ' Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are .",
    "This is perfect ! What do you think ?",
    "I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !",
    "I ' m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey !",
    "Sam , you ' Ve got to forgive me .",
    "Forgive you for what ?",
    "I used your computer . And I ' m afraid I ' Ve erased your personal files accidentally .",
    "No ! Are you kidding me ?",
    "I ' m afraid not . I apologize .",
    "I can ' t believe it ! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer . It ' s no laughing matter .",
    "I told you I ' m sorry . What can I do to make it up to you ?",
    "Well , you should be sorry ! Don ' t ever use my computer again ! You can ' t do anything now , it ' s too late !",
    "You guys are charging me $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw .",
    "Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening .",
    "Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .",
    "Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .",
    "I knew you'd see it my way .",
    "Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .",
    "Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?",
    "Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .",
    "This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !",
    "If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .",
    "Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?",
    "Sorry , I thought you knew .",
    "But you should have told me you were in love with her .",
    "Didn't I ?",
    "You know you didn't .",
    "Well , I'm telling you now .",
    "Yes , but you might have told me before .",
    "I didn't think you'd be interested .",
    "You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?",
    "Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .",
    "Oh , you men ! You're all the same .",
    "Hey , look , there is a circus show over there .",
    "I'm not in the mood .",
    "It's the circus .",
    "I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .",
    "Oh , come on , they give them treat too . Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .",
    "Cute ? Hope so .",
    "Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .",
    "Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .",
    "Why are you acting so strange today ?",
    "I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .",
    "That's weird !",
    "Mike ! Look at the floor !",
    "What's wrong with it ?",
    "What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !",
    "Oh ...",
    "It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .",
    "Sorry , love .",
    "What are you looking for now ?",
    "My cigarettes .",
    "Well , they ' re not here . They are in the dustbin .",
    "In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?",
    "Alright , tell me what you think .",
    "Don't you think it ' s a bit bright ?",
    "Yeah , maybe you ' re right . How about this outfit ?",
    "This dress looks lovely on you , but it ' s not very practical , is it ?",
    "No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ' s casual , yet sophisticated .",
    "I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ' s too plain on its own .",
    "How about this scarf , these earrings , AMD an anklet ?",
    "That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?",
    "That ' s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .",
    "Thanks . You ' d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",
    "Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?",
    "That looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?",
    "The leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?",
    "No , they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .",
    "That ' s even better than the real thing .",
    "If I were you , I ' d buy that now while it ' s on sale . If you spend $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .",
    "It ' s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday !",
    "I want to get on the bus already .",
    "It just isn't on time today .",
    "It was supposed to be here thirty minutes ago .",
    "I think it'll be here pretty soon .",
    "I need to get to work , so it better .",
    "I really do hate public transportation .",
    "I agree , it's just never on time .",
    "That's right .",
    "I also hate having to stand at a bus stop in all kinds of weather .",
    "Oh , that's the worst .",
    "We need to get a car .",
    "I completely agree with that .",
    "I hate computer games .",
    "Why ? They are fine .",
    "Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .",
    "Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .",
    "If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .",
    "Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games .",
    "Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ?",
    "Sure , here you go .",
    "Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too .",
    "Of course . There you are .",
    "Thanks so much . I owe you one .",
    "Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ...",
    "Hello , welcome to Universal Bank . Please insert your card into the slot .",
    "I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ' m an idiot ...",
    "Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the pound key . Thank you . Please select an option . Thank you . You have selected withdrawal .",
    "Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money !",
    "Please type the amount you would like to withdraw . Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 .",
    "No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No !",
    "Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye !",
    "No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money !",
    "Danger , danger ! The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . Thank you for using our bank . Have a nice day .",
    "I don't know how to adjust my life . Would you give me a piece of advice ?",
    "You look a bit pale , don't you ?",
    "Yes , I can't sleep well every night .",
    "You should get plenty of sleep .",
    "I drink a lot of wine .",
    "If I were you , I wouldn't drink too much .",
    "I often feel so tired .",
    "You better do some exercise every morning .",
    "I sometimes find the shadow of death in front of me .",
    "Why do you worry about your future ? You're very young , and you'll make great contribution to the world . I hope you take my advice .",
    "Can I get you something to drink ?",
    "Sure , but I don't drink much . So I don't know what to order .",
    "So how about an aperitif ?",
    "It sounds good . I'd like to start with a Compare .",
    "Stirred or shaken ?",
    "Stirred will be fine .",
    "Here you are .",
    "Thanks . Does the bar have a signature drink ?",
    "Sure . All of our mixed drinks are excellent . You can also try a delicious non-alcoholic cocktail .",
    "Can you recommend one ?",
    "Try a Stinger . It has lime juice and grenadine over ice .",
    "It sounds interesting . I'll take one .",
    "Here we go .",
    "It tastes great .",
    "Enjoy yourself .",
    "Yeah .",
    "Are you free tomorrow night ?",
    "Yes , I am .",
    "Shall we have dinner together ?",
    "Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?",
    "Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .",
    "OK . I'll be happy to join you .",
    "Matthew ? Hi !",
    "Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?",
    "It's got to be almost a year now .",
    "How have you been ?",
    "I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .",
    "Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?",
    "Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .",
    "Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?",
    "Mrs . Thou ?",
    "Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .",
    "Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !",
    "I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?",
    "Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .",
    "I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?",
    "My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L . A . Hank and I will be flying there tonight .",
    "I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?",
    "Doctors aren't sure yet . But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .",
    "You need a babysitter .",
    "Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight . Maybe even for two nights .",
    "I could have Suzy stay at my place .",
    "I don't want to do that to you , Karen .",
    "Why not ?",
    "Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .",
    "I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston . She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .",
    "I'd like to talk with her . This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .",
    "I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .",
    "I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it . But I'd rather have someone a little older .",
    "I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .",
    "Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .",
    "Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ?",
    "No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream .",
    "What's that ?",
    "It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit .",
    "Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ?",
    "Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska .",
    "Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ?",
    "Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian .",
    "God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight !",
    "That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat !",
    "We have been here for about five days and I have to leave now .",
    "Ok ! You know you're always welcome here . Did you enjoy your stay ?",
    "Yes , we have a very pleasant time . Thank you for being so nice for us .",
    "It's our pleasure . And is there anything else we can do for you before you leave here ?",
    "No , thanks . You've done a lot for us . Thank you for everything .",
    "Don't mention it . Oh , This is a small gift for you .",
    "Oh ! Thank you ! It's very kind of you .",
    "We hope you could visit our company again .",
    "We're sure we will . And welcome to our corporation next year . We're expecting you .",
    "Ok ! We'll definitely go to visit your company .",
    "Francis , you have done an outstanding work in the past six months . In view of your achievement , I trust you ' re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title .",
    "I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .",
    "This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .",
    "Thank you , I will be doing my best .",
    "It's nice of you to see me off .",
    "It's my pleasure . Hope you ' ll visit Beijing more often .",
    "Thanks . Stop here now .",
    "OK . I hope you have a good trip . Thanks ever so much for your cooperation , Mr . Simpson . Give my best wishes to Mr . Green .",
    "OK , I will . Goodbye and remember to look me up if ever you're in Paris .",
    "Goodbye and all the best .",
    "OK , bye for now !",
    "Bye .",
    "David , I ' m going to China .",
    "Really ? How did you get the chance ?",
    "You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ' t have to pay for my trip .",
    "Congratulations . How lucky you are !",
    "Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .",
    "I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .",
    "I ' m sure I will .",
    "Have a nice journey , Lily .",
    "Thank you , David .",
    "Hey daddy ! You look great today . I like your tie ! By the way , I was wondering can I ...",
    "NO !",
    "I haven't even told you what it is yet !",
    "Okay , okay , what do you want ?",
    "Do you think I could borrow the car ? I ' m going to a concert tonight .",
    "Um .. I don ' t think so . I need the car tonight to pick up your mother .",
    "Egg ! I told you about it last week ! Smelly Toes is playing , and Eric asked if I would go with him !",
    "Who's this Eric guy ?",
    "Duh ! He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school ! Come on , dad ! Please !",
    "No can do ... sorry .",
    "Fine then ! Would you mind giving me 100 bucks ?",
    "No way !",
    "That ' s so unfair !",
    "I hate to go outside .",
    "Me too .",
    "Why do you hate to go outside ?",
    "I meet too many jerks .",
    "I agree .",
    "This city is full of jerks .",
    "Rude people are everywhere .",
    "But what can you do ?",
    "You can yell at them .",
    "And they will yell back at you .",
    "Yelling doesn't do any good .",
    "No . The best thing to do is just stay home .",
    "... so , I said , let ' s take a break . And since that night , I ' Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ' t heard from him . You don ' t think he ' s seeing someone else , do you ?",
    "Come on , don ' t be so dramatic ! I ' m sure everything is going to work out just fine .",
    "You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ' m sure he ' s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ' t he call ?",
    "But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .",
    "He ' s the love of my life ! I ' Ve really messed this up .",
    "Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ' s going to be alright .",
    "But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ' s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ' Ve totally messed this up !",
    "You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ' m sure he ' ll forgive you ...",
    "No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ' Ve ruined everything ...",
    "do you hear something ?",
    "You ' re home late today , David . How was school ?",
    "Not bad . There ' s a new English teacher .",
    "Oh , what ' s she like ?",
    "She is beautiful .",
    "Is she old or young ?",
    "She is quite young and her hair is blond .",
    "Is she strict ?",
    "Not really . Her eyes are blue .",
    "Can she speak Chinese ?",
    "Not much . She is very tall and slim .",
    "David , stop dreaming . It ' s time to do your homework .",
    "It's quiet everywhere in winter .",
    "Yes . I like winter .",
    "Me too .",
    "It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?",
    "That's a good idea . Let's go !",
    "What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .",
    "Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .",
    "I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .",
    "Yes . Very wonderful .",
    "There is a snowman over there .",
    "How lovely it is !",
    "how are you doing , Christopher ?",
    "to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !",
    "are you doing anything this weekend ?",
    "I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !",
    "are you available on Sunday ?",
    "yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .",
    "ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?",
    "that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?",
    "it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .",
    "what should I bring with me ?",
    "we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .",
    "I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .",
    "do you like surfing ?",
    "I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?",
    "we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !",
    "I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?",
    "you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .",
    "ok , where and when should I meet you ?",
    "we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !",
    "Hi , what can I get for you ?",
    "Hello , may I have a double cheeseburger ?",
    "With everything on it ?",
    "That sounds great .",
    "Did you want fries with your order ?",
    "May I get a large order of curly fries ?",
    "Did you want something to drink ?",
    "Get me a medium Pepsi .",
    "Would you like anything else ?",
    "No , thank you . That's it .",
    "No problem , that'll be $ 5 . 48 .",
    "Thanks a lot . Keep the change .",
    "Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ?",
    "Yeah , I'm afraid so .",
    "If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .",
    "Yes , it is annoying .",
    "See how many people are here !",
    "Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here !",
    "Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company .",
    "Can we just sit wherever we want ?",
    "Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back .",
    "Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ?",
    "Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing !",
    "Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps !",
    "Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you .",
    "I just hope he doesn't start bragging again !",
    "I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus !",
    "Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ?",
    "Good afternoon , how can I help you ?",
    "Someone has stolen my gold necklace .",
    "I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ?",
    "Of course not .",
    "Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room ?",
    "Yes , I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ' t find it .",
    "Ok , when and where did you last see it ?",
    "Last night on the dresser . I took it off before I went to the shower , and forgot to put it back on after the shower . And this morning I left the hotel in a hurry without wearing it .",
    "Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ?",
    "Yes , I am positive .",
    "Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ?",
    "Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back .",
    "Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ' s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so .",
    "That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now .",
    "I am sorry , ma ' am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ' d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me , I'll go and find our assistant manager for you .",
    "You look kind of green .",
    "I don ' t feel so good . I am feeling sick to my stomach .",
    "Have you had anything to eat lately ?",
    "I had fried shrimp and clams for lunch .",
    "Perhaps the food was bad .",
    "Perhaps , but I haven ' t felt well for a few days now .",
    "Has anything been upsetting you lately ?",
    "My stress level is pretty much what is usually is .",
    "Do you think that maybe you are getting the flu ?",
    "It seems to me like I may have caught a bug .",
    "Hello , three-five .",
    "Is that Anne ?",
    "I'm sorry , I'm very tired . I'm going to bed early . I didn't have good time , and I don't really want to see you again .",
    "What are you talking about ? We had a great time . We laughed and talked all night last time .",
    "It was hardly all night . And I recall it was you doing all the laughing at your own jokes .",
    "That's not fair . We had fun . Give me a second chance . Can we meet tomorrow night for drinks at the pub ?",
    "No , I ' m sorry . I'm going to meet some friends tomorrow evening . And I ' m too tired now . I have to go to sleep . Goodbye .",
    "But Anne ...",
    "I just discovered that I owe $ 10 for a movie that I never ordered .",
    "Let me check , sir . You were charged for watching ' Titanic ' Monday night .",
    "That is absolutely incorrect ! I was out on the town Monday night .",
    "Okay , sir , bear with me a moment .",
    "Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word .",
    "One slight problem , sir . I need to charge you $ 2 to remove this error from your file .",
    "You can",
    "I feel your pain , sir .",
    "Absolutely unbelievable ! You people should be ashamed of yourselves .",
    "I agree with you , sir , but all I do is work here .",
    "I swear I will never shop at a street market in China . It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers ! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something .",
    "cool down , Harry ! What are you really mad about ? Did you get ripped off ?",
    "yes . Last Sunday I went to a nearby market . It was on open-air fair . I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot , without even trying to strike a bargain . I paid one hundred and twenty . And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced . I could have talked my way to thirty .",
    "is that so ? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you . Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals . It's the norm of free trade . The seller sets a preposterous price , and the buyer tries his best to bring it down , until a compromise is reached . Yet you ignored the process . No wonder you ended up easy prey .",
    "but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin ?",
    "of course , that's something really irritating . And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff . I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first . And then you may negotiate for a fair deal .",
    "Excuse me sir . May I come in ?",
    "Mike , you're late again .",
    "I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I",
    "Do you think I believe the story like that ?",
    "But it's true .",
    "How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?",
    "That's coincident .",
    "Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time .",
    "I promise I will .",
    "You'd better .",
    "Hi , Victor . How are you ?",
    "Oh , I'm fine .",
    "So , are you going to go to class tonight ?",
    "Maybe ... but I don't think so .",
    "Really ? What's the matter ?",
    "I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .",
    "Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .",
    "Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .",
    "I like this apartment . Do you think we can afford the mortgage ?",
    "Yes . I think so . It ' s not a very expensive apartment . It ' s in the right area and it has everything that we are looking for . The rooms are quite large too .",
    "I love the balcony . We can sit outside and enjoy the sun in summer . We are on the 12th floor , so there ' s very nice view from the balcony .",
    "The neighbourhood is nice too . There is a park nearby .",
    "Yes , and there are many houses nearby . I like it that the neighbourhood isn ' t full of apartment blocks .",
    "It ' s a pity we can ' t afford a house . A garden would be so nice .",
    "Yes , it would . Don ' t worry . There ' s a lawn outside the building and there ' s the park nearby . This place will be fine .",
    "The building is quite new and well constructed . I ' m happy with the fittings too .",
    "Yes , everything has been well designed .",
    "What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring .",
    "Thank you .",
    "Is that your wedding ring ?",
    "I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .",
    "Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?",
    "In June .",
    "Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?",
    "Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .",
    "You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .",
    "Thank you so much .",
    "What kind of watch is it ?",
    "It's a Tag Heer .",
    "If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?",
    "This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .",
    "That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .",
    "Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .",
    "Well , Yuri , tell me about it .",
    "I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster .",
    "That's what I was afraid of .",
    "It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides . Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .",
    "Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .",
    "That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported . But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site .",
    "Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country . But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes . Our operations here are finished !",
    "I'm sorry , sir .",
    "It's not your fault , Yuri . But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?",
    "Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car . If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch .",
    "Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .",
    "But sir ...",
    "Yes , Yuri ?",
    "I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now . Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe .",
    "Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?",
    "No , sir . The bridges are fine . But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains . There has been fighting , sir .",
    "Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .",
    "You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported .",
    "Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped . No , I can't believe this mess !",
    "I'm sorry , sir .",
    "You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault . But me--I'm the one who should be sorry . It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ?",
    "Alright , tell me what you think about this one .",
    "Don't you think it's a bit bright ?",
    "Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?",
    "That dress looks lovely on you , but it's not very practical , is it ?",
    "No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .",
    "I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It's too plain on its own .",
    "How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?",
    "That might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?",
    "That's a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .",
    "Thanks . You'd be OK on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",
    "Yep . Here it is . What do you think ?",
    "That looks great . Just one more thing-you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?",
    "The leopard print sounds fabulous . OK , I'll take it .",
    "You look so happy , Anna . Any good news ?",
    "Yes . I ' Ve won the first prize in the math contest .",
    "Really ? Congratulations !",
    "Thank you , Paul .",
    "By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .",
    "Good , happy birthday to you !",
    "Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?",
    "Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .",
    "My pleasure .",
    "Steven , we are preparing a martial arts show for the New Year's party . Would you like to join us ?",
    "I'd love to ! But I have never learned martial arts , and there is only a month left before the New Year .",
    "That's OK . A month is enough for you to learn the basic movements . It would be great to have you with us on the show .",
    "Sounds great ! Shall I learn the actions that Jet Li did in the movies ?",
    "No . You know , there are many schools and styles of kung fu . What we will perform is a set of Chinese shadow boxing .",
    "Whatever ! I'm glad to learn something of Chinese kung fu . Thanks for asking me .",
    "Thank you for joining us ! Now let's see some pictures and know more about kung fu .",
    "Good !",
    "John , I ' Ve asked you not to smoke in here ! I don ' t want to see you smoking in my office again .",
    "I ' m sorry , Ms . Fairbanks . I won ' t let it happen again .",
    "That ' s what you said the last time ! If you want to smoke , you ' ll have to use your break time and go outside !",
    "I understand , Ms . Fairbanks .",
    "Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !",
    "What is it ? What happened ?",
    "I think someone is stalking me .",
    "No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?",
    "I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring . He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .",
    "What did you do ?",
    "I didn't do anything . Finally , he left . But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .",
    "Did he leave when you left ?",
    "Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .",
    "What did you do ?",
    "Marketing manage office , can I help you ?",
    "Mr Green , please .",
    "Sorry , he's out .",
    "What time you suspect back them ?",
    "Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?",
    "No , thanks . I'll call back later .",
    "That's fine . please call again later .",
    "Ok , thank you . Goodbye .",
    "Linda , this is Todd calling .",
    "Todd , I am so happy you called !",
    "Linda , I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night .",
    "Boy , Todd , that was one great movie you picked out ! Thanks for asking me to go with you !",
    "I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday .",
    "A hike would be great ! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch , OK ?",
    "Linda , that would be a perfect addition .",
    "I'll take care of the lunch then , and you can take care of the other plans . What time would you like to pick me up ?",
    "I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won \\ ' t be too hot for the hike .",
    "Nine is a great time to get started . I'll see you on Saturday !",
    "Did your meal meet with your approval ?",
    "Our meal was absolutely perfect !",
    "How about a dessert to top off that wonderful meal ?",
    "Dessert sounds perfect , but I would like to split something with my friends .",
    "On this evening's dessert list , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp .",
    "I think that the apple crisp would be wonderful .",
    "One dessert will serve two , so would you like to split a second one ?",
    "We would also like a piece of chocolate mousse cake . Could you bring us four dessert forks , please ?",
    "How about some coffee and tea as well ?",
    "We are all tea drinkers . Please bring us four teas .",
    "I will prepare your desserts and have someone bring you your drinks right away .",
    "The hot drinks first would be great . Thanks !",
    "Well , how did you enjoy your seaside trip ?",
    "It was funny .",
    "Tell me about it , will you ?",
    "Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .",
    "Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?",
    "Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .",
    "You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?",
    "We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .",
    "So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .",
    "Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .",
    "Well , I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .",
    "Stay for dinner with us .",
    "I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .",
    "Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .",
    "It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .",
    "Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .",
    "John , I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year .",
    "I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .",
    "You can't be serious !",
    "Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .",
    "After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .",
    "Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .",
    "You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !",
    "Whatever you say !",
    "The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here !",
    "Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .",
    "That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !",
    "Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .",
    "I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .",
    "You are an outgoing person , quite easy to talk with .",
    "Yes , my friends like to get along with me well .",
    "Do you have many friends ?",
    "Yes , I like to make new friends .",
    "What do you usually do with them ?",
    "We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .",
    "Is there a problem , officer ?",
    "I stopped you for driving through a red light .",
    "Did I really ?",
    "You didn't know ?",
    "I had no idea that I ran it .",
    "Don't you know that yellow means slow down ?",
    "Yes , madam .",
    "Why'd you speed up instead ?",
    "I really have no excuse , madam .",
    "I'll have to write you a ticket .",
    "I understand , and I am very sorry .",
    "Here's your ticket .",
    "You have been doing a great job this year and I am very satisfied with your work .",
    "I am very happy to know my work could be recognized by you and our company .",
    "Based on your contribution , I would like to give you a pay raise . Your monthly salary will be increased by 800 Yuan . This increase includes an 80 % married increase based on your achievements and increase responsibilities and then the additional 20 % increase were reflecting the changes in cost of living .",
    "I really appreciate it . Thank you .",
    "Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ?",
    "It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .",
    "Where is the school cafeteria ?",
    "It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .",
    "Where is the Computer Center ?",
    "The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .",
    "Where is the library ?",
    "The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ' s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .",
    "Thank you . I will go get one .",
    "Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .",
    "Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .",
    "Thanks you for the encouragement .",
    "You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye .",
    "Have a good day . Bye-Bye !",
    "Hey , don ' t walk on the lawn .",
    "Sorry , I ' m looking for my wallet .",
    "You lost your wallet ? Anything important in it ?",
    "Yes . A lot of cash . Almost forty thousand pounds .",
    "Oh , I ' m sorry to hear that . I think you ' d better talk to the police officer walking there .",
    "It seems that is a better way . Thank you .",
    "You are welcome .",
    "I am so busy today .",
    "Can I help you ?",
    "I ' m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .",
    "I ' ll be glad to help .",
    "Or maybe make the beds .",
    "All you have to do is ask for help .",
    "Thanks . That ' s terrific !",
    "I ' m ready and willing to help .",
    "Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness .",
    "You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .",
    "Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .",
    "You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .",
    "No wonder people say",
    "Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !",
    "I didn't know you liked bird-watching .",
    "I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .",
    "This looks like a very nice house .",
    "You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .",
    "The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for !",
    "The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .",
    "This home is gorgeous on the inside !",
    "Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .",
    "The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .",
    "Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .",
    "I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .",
    "The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .",
    "There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .",
    "I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .",
    "Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland .",
    "Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars !",
    "Whoa , that ' s a lot of cash ! Let ' s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing .",
    "All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ' s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole !",
    "Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ' s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous .",
    "Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ' s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot .",
    "It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it .",
    "Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control !",
    "Can I have my check , please .",
    "Here it is . 350 Yuan all together .",
    "May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it .",
    "Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt .",
    "Thank you .",
    "Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .",
    "Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ?",
    "You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ?",
    "Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now .",
    "Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .",
    "You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?",
    "Yes .",
    "Got it . Bye for now .",
    "Hi , Mary , I have decided to look for a job as a salesman .",
    "Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ?",
    "Yes . I have found some through different channels .",
    "Really ? That's great ! Tell me .",
    "OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet , and it is about selling medicines .",
    "What do you think of this job ?",
    "I am not familiar with the medicine industry , and I don't think it fits me well .",
    "Then how about the others ?",
    "Another is about electronic commerce , and its products are mainly large machinery equipments .",
    "I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development .",
    "I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try .",
    "Come on ! I believe you will succeed .",
    "Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet .",
    "Good idea . I will think it over .",
    "I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It's unbelievable .",
    "Oh , my dear lady , take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .",
    "He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .",
    "I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .",
    "I've told him how to do that several times , but he's never listened to me .",
    "Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend , not a boss .",
    "Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .",
    "Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do . Make sure you won't lose your temper !",
    "Oh , so bad . I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself .",
    "No , it's unnecessary . Just respect the staff and their own opinions .",
    "But sometimes they offer some useless proposals , it's awfully useless .",
    "Oh , no one is perfect .",
    "That's right . I should speak to them in a polite way .",
    "We have the equal partnership in team .",
    "Thanks very much and you're very eloquent .",
    "Thanks for saying that .",
    "That was really a nightmare !",
    "Honey , what's up ?",
    "I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .",
    "Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ?",
    "I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .",
    "Did you panic at the time ?",
    "A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there .",
    "Was there anyone else with you ?",
    "Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying .",
    "So you mean that you were the only brave one there ?",
    "Yes . I have to call the property management .",
    "For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ?",
    "Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building .",
    "That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on .",
    "I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience .",
    "Great . The bed is exactly what I have been looking for !",
    "You have good taste . It's made of red wood .",
    "Oh , I like red wood . How much do you charge for it ?",
    "300 dollars .",
    "That's sheer robbery !",
    "Believe me , it's worth the price .",
    "It's more than I can afford . Can I make an offer ?",
    "How much are you willing to pay ?",
    "Shall we make it 250 dollars ?",
    "No . That price would hardly cover the cost .",
    "What about 260 dollars ?",
    "275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer .",
    "It's a deal .",
    "You ' re home late today , David . How was school ?",
    "Not bad . There ' s a new English teacher .",
    "Oh , what ' s she like ?",
    "She is beautiful .",
    "Is she old or young ?",
    "She is quite young and her hair is blond .",
    "Is she strict ?",
    "Not really . Her eyes are blue .",
    "Can she speak Chinese ?",
    "Not much . She is very tall and slim .",
    "David , stop dreaming . It ' s time to do your homework .",
    "Have you got your invitation yet ?",
    "My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?",
    "The house warming party .",
    "Whose house warming party is it ?",
    "Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .",
    "Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .",
    "It's out in the suburbs .",
    "Have you seen the house ?",
    "Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .",
    "Is it nice ?",
    "Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . There's also a garden .",
    "Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?",
    "They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .",
    "When are they going to have the party ?",
    "Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .",
    "Wow , that would be something to look forward to .",
    "alright , tell me what you think .",
    "don't you think it ' s a bit bright ?",
    "yeah , maybe you ' re right . How about this outfit ?",
    "that dress looks lovely on you , but it ' s not very practical , is it ?",
    "no , I don't have an plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just had to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It ' s casual , yet sophisticated .",
    "I like the jeans , but you need something to go with the top . It ' s too plain on its own .",
    "how about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ?",
    "that might be going overboard a bit . How about just that scarf with a bracelet ?",
    "that ' s a good idea . You have a lot of good fashion sense .",
    "thanks . You ' d be ok on your own . There are loads of fashion victims out there , and you are not one of them . Have you tried it on yet ?",
    "yep . Here it is . What do you think ?",
    "that looks great . Just one more thing---you need some high heels with those jeans . Do you want a pair with a plain pattern or ones with a leopard print on them ?",
    "the leopard print sounds fabulous . Are they a name brand ?",
    "no , they ' re a Prada knock-off for 1/10 of the price of the real thing .",
    "that ' s even better than the real thing .",
    "if I were you , I ' d buy that now while it ' s on sale . If you spend more than $ 100 , you get a $ 50 voucher for more clothes .",
    "it ' s too bad I did all that shopping yesterday !",
    "Hey , Blake ! Are you still listening to Mozart ?",
    "Yes . Do you like it ?",
    "It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .",
    "Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .",
    "Is classical music your favorite ?",
    "Yes . What about you ?",
    "I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .",
    "Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .",
    "Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .",
    "Did you always like pop music .",
    "I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .",
    "I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .",
    "oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .",
    "Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .",
    "Hello , ma ' am , can I help you find something ?",
    "Yes , actually I ' m looking to buy a camera .",
    "We ' Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ' d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?",
    "Actually I ' m buying a camera for my husband .",
    "Ah , well then I ' d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .",
    "Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?",
    "Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .",
    "The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok , but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .",
    "Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .",
    "Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .",
    "Oh , well this one has the , uh .",
    "Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !",
    "So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ...",
    "Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?",
    "Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry , ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .",
    "No you ' re not ! There are some right here !",
    "Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .",
    "Thanks for your help , Ralph !",
    "No problem , ma ' am .",
    "Hi ! I see you are having fun with your new computer and internet connection .",
    "There ' s so much I want to do . I ' Ve just finished sending lots of emails to friends and family all over the world . I just ran a search for music to download .",
    "I can give you the name of a few useful website to visit .",
    "Thanks . That would be very helpful . I ' Ve discovered that it can take a long time to find exactly what you want . There ' s too much information on the net .",
    "When you sent your emails , did you attach any files to them ?",
    "Yes , I did . There ' s an anti-virus programme with my email account that scans all attachments , so I ' m sure I haven ' t sent anything nasty to anyone .",
    "When you use the internet , be careful not to give out your email address very often . If you do , you might get a lot of spam-unwanted email form companies trying to sell you things .",
    "That ' s good advice . I should also be careful about giving out confidential information about myself , such as my password and credit car number .",
    "That ' s right . Another thing to remember when you are surfing is that you can add a web page to your list of favourites . Your computer will remember the page and you can return there quickly next time",
    "How do I do that ?",
    "Take this web page for example . Press the keys control and d together . Click on favourites at the top of the screen . There you are . It has been added to you favourites list . If you click it , you will",
    "That ' s useful to know . Thanks . I ' ll just log off and shout down my computer and we can go for a coffee .",
    "Ah ! No ! Damn it !",
    "It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .",
    "So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .",
    "Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?",
    "No , I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .",
    "I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .",
    "I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .",
    "What are we going to do now ?",
    "I don't know . I feel like going out .",
    "I wonder how much of the city is down .",
    "It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .",
    "Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed . And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .",
    "Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .",
    "I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .",
    "Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?",
    "I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .",
    "Maybe we can trade . Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ?",
    "No , it just won't work . If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .",
    "So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?",
    "How many students are in the class ?",
    "About fourteen .",
    "So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .",
    "Damn !",
    "Next please ! Hello sir , may I see your passport please ?",
    "Yes , here you go .",
    "Will you be checking any bags today .",
    "Yes , I ' d like to check three pieces .",
    "I ' m sorry , sir . Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage , at twenty kilograms each , plus one piece of carry-on luggage . I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase .",
    "What ? Why ! I am taking an intercontinental flight ! I ' m flying sixteen thousand CMS ! How am I supposed to only take two , twenty kilo bags ? That ' absurd !",
    "I am sorry , sir , there ' s nothing I can do . You cannot board the flight with that large bag either . Carry - on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat . That bag is clearly too big .",
    "Now I see . You charge next to nothing for an international ticket , but when it comes to charging for any other small thing , you charge an arm and a leg ! So tell me , miss , how much will I have to pay for all of this .",
    "Let ' s see ... six hundred and twenty-five US dollars .",
    "That ' s more than my round-trip ticket !",
    "Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ?",
    "Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .",
    "Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .",
    "That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .",
    "Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .",
    "Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .",
    "They don't really think you took it , do they ?",
    "I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .",
    "How many of them were there ?",
    "Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .",
    "Like what ?",
    "Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .",
    "What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?",
    "I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .",
    "Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years .",
    "Hmm . Thank you very much .",
    "Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !",
    "Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .",
    "Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .",
    "He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .",
    "Me too .",
    "Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .",
    "Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?",
    "Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .",
    "He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .",
    "And the host announced that he won it all !",
    "Good morning , sir . Can I see your boarding pass , please ?",
    "Here you are .",
    "Excuse me , sir . This is your passport .",
    "Really ? Ugh ... Is there any difference ?",
    "Yes . As a matter of fact , you can't board the plane without boarding pass .",
    "Gee . I must have left it in my hotel room .",
    "I'm sorry sir . I can't let you pass .",
    "But when does the plane take off ?",
    "Ugh , in about thirty minutes , sir .",
    "Oh , my God ! What do I do now ? Bone head , bone head , bone head ( He smashes his head with his hand . ) .",
    "Calm down , sir . You are creating a commotion .",
    "( The speaker in the airport says , ' Mr . Benjamin , we now have a boarding pass by the name of Benjamin at Lost and Found . ' ) Is that me ?",
    "Could be .",
    "Oh , thank God . Thank you , I'll be right back .",
    "( Benjamin starts to run and then he seems to remember something and returns . ) Ugh , excuse me , where is the Lost and Found ?",
    "It's down in the lobby . Turn left at exit B .",
    "Thank you , thank you , thanks again .",
    "Good morning . I ' m from the New York book review . Could I ask you some questions about your latest book ?",
    "Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?",
    "First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .",
    "That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .",
    "How do you research your books ?",
    "I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .",
    "I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !",
    "Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .",
    "Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?",
    "There ' s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ' t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ' ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .",
    "Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .",
    "Is everything to your satisfaction ?",
    "No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .",
    "Oh ! Sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual as we have steak from the market every day .",
    "So what ? It is not fresh and I'm not happy about it .",
    "I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .",
    "No , thank you .",
    "Good afternoon , miss , can I help you ?",
    "Yes , I ' d like to buy this dress , please .",
    "It ' s certainly a pretty dress . I can ring you up at the register over here .",
    "Great .",
    "Will you be paying by cash , check , or credit card ?",
    "I want to use a credit card . Do you take Discover ?",
    "Sorry , no . We only take MasterCard or Visa .",
    "I ' ll put it on my Visa card , then .",
    "Very well , ma ' am . Oh , there seems to be a problem , it says it ' s rejected .",
    "There must be something wrong with the system . Try my MasterCard .",
    "Alright . Thank you . Yes , it seems to be working fine . Your total is $ 199 . 00 , sign here , please .",
    "Sure .",
    "Here you go , and here ' s your receipt . Have a nice day .",
    "Thanks . You have a good one , too .",
    "Why do you want to take the police to court ?",
    "They arrested me without probable cause .",
    "They did ?",
    "They had no reason for arresting me .",
    "I thought they let you go .",
    "Yes , the next morning .",
    "They made you spend the night at the station ?",
    "Yes , they did .",
    "What was their reason for arresting you ?",
    "I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for .",
    "I see .",
    "I want justice .",
    "Mr . Mass , here is a gift for you .",
    "Oh . Thanks a million .",
    "It's a souvenir I bought for you from Rome .",
    "How beautiful ! I love it at all .",
    "I'm glad you like it .",
    "It's very kind of you . I really don't know how I can thank you enough .",
    "Don't mention it . Just a little thing I did .",
    "Why don't you sit down and relax , darling ?",
    "I don't want to .",
    "Well , come over and talk to me then .",
    "Certainly not .",
    "May I turn on the TV then ?",
    "Turn on the TV for what ?",
    "So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .",
    "Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?",
    "I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .",
    "To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .",
    "Please help yourself to whatever you like , don't be shy .",
    "Yes , thank you . I've already been helping myself .",
    "This dish taste terrific . Would you like to try a little ? It is a little hot , but very good .",
    "I like hot food , especially Sichuan cuisine .",
    "Would you like another beer ?",
    "I'll have another cup of beer insist . I know I don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .",
    "Come on , it's the weekend . Let's taste and enjoy this meal . Cheers !",
    "Bottom's up , and you're right . This meal is incredible . I wish I had known this restaurant before . Thanks for bringing me here . I know I'll be back agile soon .",
    "We finally get a chance to meet .",
    "Thank you for meeting me here .",
    "It's no problem .",
    "I need to speak with you about your daughter .",
    "Is there something wrong ?",
    "I enjoy having your daughter in my class .",
    "I'm glad to hear it .",
    "She is a great addition to my class .",
    "You don't have anything bad to say about her ?",
    "She is always behaving herself , and she's so smart .",
    "I am so happy that she's doing okay .",
    "I'm more than happy having her in my class .",
    "Everything is now . I'm kind of sick of it .",
    "Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .",
    "Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !",
    "Stop making fun of me .",
    "So find a guy to marry and you can get one !",
    "I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !",
    "Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .",
    "When will I get a raise ?",
    "In three months or so ?",
    "You said the same thing three months ago .",
    "Did I ? Well . Anyway , you'll get your raise when the economy starts picking up .",
    "You mean I won't get a raise until recession ends ?",
    "Yes .",
    "I got the message . I am quitting .",
    "Hello , BCD Company , can I help you ?",
    "Hello , may I speak to Mrs Smith ?",
    "This is Mrs Smith , may I have your name ?",
    "This is Sun , and I interviewed with you yesterday .",
    "Hello , Mr . Sun .",
    "I am calling to thank you for giving me the interview for the Sales Manager position yesterday .",
    "You are welcome , Mr . Sun .",
    "I really enjoyed meeting with you .",
    "You certainly made a good impression on me , as well .",
    "I am very interested in this position .",
    "We'll be making the decision by the end of this week and we'll contact you as soon as possible .",
    "Well , thank you for your time and consideration again .",
    "You are welcome .",
    "So can you fix it ?",
    "I ' m sorry sir . This computer is not broken or damaged . It ' s simply just too old ! That ' s why your programs and applications are running slow . There really isn ' t much I can do .",
    "What do you mean ? I bought this computer just three years ago !",
    "Yes , but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster !",
    "OK , I know where this is going . How much will it cost me to get a new computer ?",
    "Well , this desktop over here is our latest model . It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte . Of course , it includes a mouse , keyboard and desk speakers .",
    "I have no idea what you are talking about . I just want to know if it ' s good and if I will be able to play solitaire without the computer crashing or freezing all the time !",
    "This PC is top of the line and I guarantee it will never freeze ! If it does , we ' ll give you your money back !",
    "it ' s so great to be here ! I ' m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !",
    "we ' re glad that you ' re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?",
    "that ' d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?",
    "sure , I ' ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen .",
    "that would be lovely , thanks .",
    "do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?",
    "I ' ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .",
    "ok . What do you think about our living room ?",
    "well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .",
    "my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .",
    "oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .",
    "your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming .",
    "I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ' m here . You two could probably use my help .",
    "that ' s very nice of you to offer . Here ' s your tea . Be careful , it ' s still quite hot .",
    "Your knowledge of English is really surprising .",
    "Oh , it's nothing to speak of .",
    "No , seriously . I am impressed .",
    "Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .",
    "Are you going to vote this Tuesday ?",
    "Yes , I am , and I am so excited .",
    "Have you figured out who you ' re going to vote for ?",
    "I love my candidate .",
    "Why is that ?",
    "My candidate is probably the most intelligent .",
    "Is that right ?",
    "I also agree with all his policies .",
    "That ' s great !",
    "I know he ' s going to be the next President .",
    "Hopefully , he will be .",
    "I can ' t wait to vote .",
    "Do you have any shoes like these ?",
    "What size ?",
    "Size five .",
    "What colour ?",
    "Black .",
    "I ' m sorry . We don't haven any .",
    "But my sister bought this pair last month .",
    "Did she buy them here ?",
    "No , she bought them in the U . S .",
    "We had some shoes like those a month ago , but we don't have any now .",
    "Can you get a pair for me please ?",
    "I ' m afraid that I can ' t . They were in fashion last year and the year before last . But they ' re not in fashion this year . These shoes are in fashion now .",
    "They look very uncomfortable .",
    "They are very uncomfortable . But women always wear uncomfortable shoes !",
    "Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon .",
    "Really ? Where did you hear that ?",
    "I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ?",
    "I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked .",
    "No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is .",
    "That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her .",
    "Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere .",
    "Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael .",
    "No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support .",
    "Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place .",
    "Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ?",
    "I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel .",
    "Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason .",
    "Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing .",
    "I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ?",
    "Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that .",
    "It's not a simple thing to be beautiful .",
    "Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ?",
    "Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange !",
    "Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne .",
    "Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it .",
    "It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly .",
    "That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ?",
    "No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft .",
    "How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her .",
    "I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits .",
    "Happy birthday , Jim !",
    "Thank you , Lisa .",
    "Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .",
    "Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .",
    "I'm very glad to hear that .",
    "Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .",
    "What happened ? Why didn't he win ?",
    "Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .",
    "How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !",
    "If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .",
    "What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?",
    "He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .",
    "I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .",
    "They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .",
    "That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .",
    "I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !",
    "Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .",
    "I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .",
    "Let's hope so .",
    "Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want .",
    "You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .",
    "Are you serious ? How can that be ?",
    "Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .",
    "Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .",
    "That's true . But I just love it . Come here !",
    "Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !",
    "You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here .",
    "Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase .",
    "Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ?",
    "Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please .",
    "What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .",
    "Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it .",
    "Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .",
    "Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often .",
    "Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price .",
    "Hey George , how is your chicken ?",
    "My chicken tastes all right , but it is pretty dry . How is your fish ?",
    "My fish is pretty dry too .",
    "It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long . It doesn't seem fresh .",
    "Yes , it seems that way to me also .",
    "How are your vegetables ?",
    "My vegetables are very soggy .",
    "Mine are the same way . It seems like they've been overcooked .",
    "I don't usually complain , but I think that we should mention this to the waiter .",
    "I agree . Maybe they can bring us some better food .",
    "How do you want your hair cut ?",
    "I want it the way Peckham wears it .",
    "Who is Peckham ?",
    "Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here .",
    "You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs .",
    "Sure , he is a soccer star .",
    "Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ?",
    "Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball .",
    "But it's the same hairstyle .",
    "It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture .",
    "Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham .",
    "He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right .",
    "Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple .",
    "Do it , please .",
    "Oh , hi , Jessica , are you going to see this movie too ?",
    "I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .",
    "Then let's go in .",
    "I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .",
    "I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .",
    "I know . I wonder what's keeping him .",
    "Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?",
    "Yeah , a number of times .",
    "What's he trying to pull anyway .",
    "I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .",
    "Maybe you should start seeing someone else .",
    "You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .",
    "Hello . I am calling about the apartment you advertised .",
    "Yes , what kind of apartment are you interested in ?",
    "I am interested in one-bedroom . Do you have any available ?",
    "Yes , I have one . When you need it ?",
    "Sometime around next week . What can you tell me about this apartment ?",
    "Well , It's a one-bedroom apartment . The monthly rent at 650 dollars and a 300 dollars security deposit . You pay electricity only . Gas and water is included . Both the heat and stove are gas . Let me see , what else ... Oh , you'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge . And that's probably it .",
    "Sounds good . May I come over tomorrow to take a look ?",
    "Sure . What time would you like to come ?",
    "How about 10 am ?",
    "Good , May I have your name , please ?",
    "My name is Blanca .",
    "Thanks for calling , Blanca . I'll see you tomorrow .",
    "Look , Jim . That man just fell down over there .",
    "We'd better see if he is ok .",
    "Sir , sir , are you all right , sir ?",
    "He is not answering . You'd better check his pulse and breathing .",
    "Oh , no . He is not breathing and there ' s no pulse . Call 911 .",
    "Hello ? Yes , someone has passed out at Dongle Ave . and 2nd street . He isn't breathing and doesn't have a pulse . Yes , my friend is performing CPR . Ok , thank you . They are sending an ambulance . Here , let me help .",
    "You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome !",
    "Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing .",
    "That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing .",
    "Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere !",
    "Come on baby , let's dance !",
    "Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down !",
    "Hi , I come to pick up my laundry . This is the invoice .",
    "Here you are . We've ironed them for you already . Please check and see if there is any damage .",
    "I'm afraid that a button is missing .",
    "I'm terribly sorry . You know we are so busy today and we forget to sew the button back on . Please wait a moment . It will be ready soon .",
    "OK , please .",
    "Would you like to have a look ? Is it to your satisfaction ?",
    "Well , oh my God , there is another problem , I'm afraid . There is still a stain on the shirt .",
    "It doesn't seem like that . Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think .",
    "It's been several days now , I am not sure .",
    "Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go .",
    "Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ?",
    "I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time .",
    "OK , I will .",
    "This is a membership card . You can get a 20 percent discount next time .",
    "Thanks a lot .",
    "Hope to see you again . We will provide the best service .",
    "I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much .",
    "I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting .",
    "I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ?",
    "The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m .",
    "( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb .",
    "I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full .",
    "What do you think of the leading actors ?",
    "Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type .",
    "You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough .",
    "Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends .",
    "Really ? What can I do ?",
    "Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .",
    "Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help .",
    "I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .",
    "Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick .",
    "No problem !",
    "Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends .",
    "Really ? What can I do ?",
    "Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment .",
    "Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help .",
    "I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face .",
    "Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick .",
    "No problem !",
    "Hey , look out !",
    "What happened ?",
    "You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off .",
    "Where ? my car ?",
    "No , mine !",
    "Thank goodness !",
    "I've just had it repainted .",
    "That's terrible .",
    "I am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful .",
    "I apologize for that . But the space is too small .",
    "What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ?",
    "Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company .",
    "OK . I gotta call mine too .",
    "Excuse me , What time does the next bus for Boston leave ?",
    "It leaves at 8",
    "I see . Are there any seat available ?",
    "Just a moment please . Yes . You can have a seat .",
    "Good . How much is it when we take it ?",
    "It thirty-eight dollars .",
    "All right . Here ' s forty dollars .",
    "Here ' s your ticket and change .",
    "Thank you . Which gate should I go to for the bus ?",
    "Go to gate No . 2 please .",
    "Thank you very much .",
    "Don ' t mention it .",
    "Are you OK ?",
    "I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story .",
    "So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ?",
    "I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending .",
    "What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep .",
    "Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before .",
    "I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive .",
    "Then I doubt if you like operas at all .",
    "Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .",
    "OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave .",
    "Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .",
    "Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings .",
    "Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show .",
    "And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing !",
    "No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .",
    "Exactly .",
    "Ah ! No ! Damn it !",
    "It's a blackout . Now I can't see Seinfeld .",
    "So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .",
    "Really ? How could you do that ? Don't you save every couple minutes ?",
    "No , I didn't save this time . Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .",
    "I've had that problem too many times . So I learned to save . When I'm writing something , I save every three sentences or so . I don't want to lose anything .",
    "I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth .",
    "What are we going to do now ?",
    "I don't know . I feel like going out .",
    "I wonder how much of the city is down .",
    "It doesn't matter . I still can go out and buy a beer .",
    "Maybe . But if there's a blackout , probably the pubs are closed . And besides , I know you have a political science exam tomorrow . I thought you had a lot of reading to do .",
    "Yes , that's true . Damn ! I just lost half my paper , and now I can't even do my homework . This is a bad time for this to happen .",
    "I have a flashlight in my closet . If you want to use that to read , you can .",
    "Thanks . I think I will try . Where are you going ?",
    "I like your idea of getting a beer . I think I'll go out myself .",
    "Maybe we can trade . Why don't you stay here and read for my exam , and I'll go drink beer ?",
    "No , it just won't work . If I read for your exam , you won't know the answers tomorrow . I will .",
    "So ? You can go to the class for me . Just write my name on the exam book and take the exam . Why not ?",
    "How many students are in the class ?",
    "About fourteen .",
    "So it won't work , old buddy . They'll see that I'm not you . Sorry .",
    "Damn !",
    "Hello , Pratt . How was your interview yesterday ?",
    "Hello , Finn . I did a wonderful job and I was employed . How about you ?",
    "I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity .",
    "Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job .",
    "Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ' Ve told me .",
    "What ? Then what did you do ?",
    "When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ' t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ' s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it .",
    "You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ' t find a job .",
    "Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations .",
    "Good luck next time .",
    "Thank you .",
    "Tim ' s smiles are interesting .",
    "Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .",
    "You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .",
    "How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !",
    "Take a seat inside and see what you think . So you will take the Porsche then , sir ?",
    "Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .",
    "You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .",
    "Can I return the car in San Francisco ?",
    "San Francisco ? No , sir . We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .",
    "Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .",
    "No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .",
    "Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .",
    "Do you still want the car , sir ?",
    "Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .",
    "It's a beautiful drive .",
    "Where are the keys ?",
    "Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms .",
    "Hi , can I help you ?",
    "No , thanks . I'm just looking .",
    "All right . If you need any help , just let me know . My name is Greg .",
    "Sure , I'll let you know if I need anything . Hm , this mattress is very firm . Jack will probably like it .",
    "Did you find something you like ?",
    "Yes , this mattress is very good . It's pretty firm . The mattress I ' m now sleeping on is saggy .",
    "You are right . This is very good brand . It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty , so you don't have to worry about its quality .",
    "Does it come with a frame ?",
    "Unfortunately , it doesn't . However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame . We also offer a very good financing plan . There is no payment no interest until next June .",
    "That's an attractive plan . I'll think about it .",
    "Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night .",
    "Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve .",
    "Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math .",
    "I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom .",
    "Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot .",
    "Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ?",
    "Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue .",
    "Oh yes , I ...",
    "Ah ! It hurts . Don't touch it .",
    "What part hurts ?",
    "The shoulder .",
    "Well , maybe you broke it . But what I'm worried about is this cut .",
    "It's not a cut . It's a gash ! It's bigger than a cut ! Ah ! I need a doctor .",
    "C'mon . Just don't move .",
    "I'm bleeding too much .",
    "We don't have a decent First Aid Kit , do we ?",
    "Yes . My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick !",
    "There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet .",
    "Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist . That will work as a tourniquet . After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound .",
    "Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut .",
    "No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood .",
    "Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ?",
    "I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts !",
    "We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .",
    "I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour . There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .",
    "Yes , I almost slid too . Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?",
    "Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped . Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .",
    "Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .",
    "There . Stop !",
    "Hi , John , this is Mary , your tenant up in Lincoln Park .",
    "Oh , hi , Mary , what can I do for you ?",
    "I was wondering when trash collection day was .",
    "It ' s on Tuesdays and Fridays .",
    "Great .",
    "You could save a couple of dollars by taking it to the dump yourself , though .",
    "Oh , o . k . Where ' s that ?",
    "It ' s at the corner of that street .",
    "Thanks . Who do I call for trash collection ?",
    "Just leave the stuff by the curb . The company ' ll send a guy out next month to give you the bill .",
    "All right . Thanks a lot .",
    "No problem .",
    "Who are those guys ?",
    "Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players .",
    "Oh .",
    "Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !",
    "All right !",
    "Here comes Jordan , though .",
    "Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .",
    "Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .",
    "Which team do you think will win ?",
    "The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .",
    "Do you think they two will get married ?",
    "Yeah , you can count on it .",
    "I think so . Yes , they get along so well .",
    "I like him . He's good for her .",
    "You're right . He sure is .",
    "Did you enjoy your meal ?",
    "Yes , we really enjoyed it .",
    "May I interest you in some dessert ?",
    "Yes , that sounds great .",
    "Well , we have chocolate mousse cake , homemade fresh strawberry shortcake , and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials .",
    "The apple crisp sounds great .",
    "Since there are four of you , would you like to split a second dessert ?",
    "Good suggestion . Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks , please ?",
    "Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert ?",
    "Let's have four coffees , please .",
    "OK . I will be right back with your desserts and drinks .",
    "Thank you ! We have really enjoyed our meal here .",
    "Is there anything I can do for you ?",
    "Would you please show me that mural ?",
    "Certainly . Here you are .",
    "It looks so beautiful . How much is it ?",
    "Four hundred yuan .",
    "That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ?",
    "I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .",
    "Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it .",
    "Well , I'll have it wrapped for you .",
    "Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan .",
    "Thank you . Please come again .",
    "Will you sit down , Mr . White ?",
    "Thank you . It's very kind of you to invite me to such a beautiful place .",
    "I propose a toast to your pleasant tour in China .",
    "Thank you very much .",
    "This food is a Wax specialty . Please help yourself .",
    "Thank you . Oh , it tastes nice .",
    "Come again ? What are you talking about ? Aren't we on the same team now ?",
    "Guess again , Dave . I have no intention of leaving invoking . Never did .",
    "What do you mean ? You didn't ? Oh , no ... No !",
    "That's right , Dave . I tricked you into giving a confession . And I've recorded every word of it .",
    "But how ? So you knew all along I was with WebTracker ? How did you know ?",
    "I saw your green post-it notes . Nobody else has them .",
    "It ' s so great to be here ! I ' m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !",
    "We ' re glad that you ' re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?",
    "That ' d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?",
    "Sure , I ' ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen .",
    "That would be lovely , thanks .",
    "Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?",
    "I ' ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .",
    "Ok . What do you think about our living room ?",
    "Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .",
    "My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .",
    "Oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .",
    "Your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming .",
    "I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ' m here . You two could probably use my help .",
    "That ' s very nice of you to offer . Here ' s your tea . Be careful , it ' s still quite hot .",
    "Please come in , Steven .",
    "All right , Mr . Green .",
    "Have a seat over there . How are things going out in the office ?",
    "Pretty well . Everyone is working hard .",
    "But , our business has been going down sharply the couple of months and we have to reduce some staff .",
    "You mean I'm among the people who have to go ?",
    "I'm afraid so .",
    "Did I do something wrong ?",
    "You're the sales manager , but our sales didn't go up .",
    "But you know I've been working very hard . And I have a family to support .",
    "I feel sorry , but that's the decision of the directorate .",
    "Hey . Why did you take that money ? You are such a cheater ! I should send you to jail !",
    "I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !",
    "Well you can ' t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ' m the banker .",
    "Banker ?",
    "Yes ...",
    "Can I have my $ 200 please ?",
    "Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice .",
    "I have some great news ! I was able to switch to the night shift !",
    "I knew everything would work out for you !",
    "I got to meet the night Anger today too . We got along right from the start .",
    "Wonderful ! Do you already have your work schedule ?",
    "Not yet , I pick it up tomorrow .",
    "Do you know what you will be doing yet ?",
    "Yes , I'll be managing the guys on the dock .",
    "You're so good with people . I think they will like you !",
    "Oh . Henry . I haven't seen you in ages . Come in . Let me take your coat . How are you getting along ?",
    "Very well , thank you .",
    "Please take a seat . Everything will be ready in a minute .",
    "Here you go . We have your cocktail and there're salad . fried chicken , French fries and vanilla ice cream for dessert . Eat the chicken while it's hot . It tastes better .",
    "Wow ! You're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper .",
    "Here you are . Taste the French fries .",
    "They're soft .",
    "Would you like some more ?",
    "No more . Thank you .",
    "Here's to our friendship and health !",
    "Bottoms up !",
    "What ' s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?",
    "We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .",
    "How hard is the climb ?",
    "It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .",
    "What did you do last week ?",
    "We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .",
    "Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ' m sorry I missed it .",
    "Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .",
    "Yeah , I will . See you then !",
    "O . K . See you .",
    "I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today . And I got a job .",
    "Congratulation . What will you do ?",
    "They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .",
    "That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do .",
    "It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up .",
    "Good . I'll do it .",
    "Poor Danny . You are so enfeebled !",
    "Don't worry . No big deal . Just a common cold .",
    "Mom called just now saying that she and Dad will be back later . Do you want to speak to them on phone ?",
    "No . You can never count on the grown-ups when there is something .",
    "Whatever . Have a drink of water .",
    "Come on , sister . This is the seventh glass already .",
    "Maybe later . I think we have a medicine-kit .",
    "Do we ? Where is it ?",
    "Probably on the of the cabinet . I'll go and get it .",
    "Be careful . Now I have no one but you to depend on .",
    "Oh , here it is . Patulin . Oh , no !",
    "What's the new strike ?",
    "Keep lying down . The matter is that all the medicine here is past expiration .",
    "Poor me !",
    "How do you arrange this summer vacation ?",
    "I want to travel .",
    "Where would you like to go ?",
    "The seaside .",
    "That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .",
    "I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .",
    "Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .",
    "Thank you !",
    "My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds .",
    "Oh , really ?",
    "The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too .",
    "Well , it's a good thing for you .",
    "Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has .",
    "So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ?",
    "I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food .",
    "junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat .",
    "But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous .",
    "Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it .",
    "Yes , but life without chips , ice cream and coca cola is boring .",
    "Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit .",
    "Well , that sounds better than giving it up .",
    "Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?",
    "Sorry , I thought you knew .",
    "But you should tell me you were in love with her .",
    "Didn't I ?",
    "You know you didn't .",
    "Well , I am telling you now .",
    "Yes , but you might have told me before .",
    "I didn't think you would be interested .",
    "You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?",
    "Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .",
    "Oh , you men ! You are all the same .",
    "Excuse me , are you Mrs . Green from England ?",
    "Yes , I am .",
    "I'm pleased to meet you , Mrs . Green . My name is Myra . I work in Beijing Institute of Technology . I came here to meet you .",
    "How do you do ?",
    "How do you do ?",
    "It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .",
    "Welcome to Beijing . Is this your first time in China ?",
    "No , I have visited China several times , but it's my first visit to Beijing and I think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .",
    "It's our pleasure to have you here . I hope you will have a pleasant stay here .",

    "Good afternoon , sir , is there anything I can help you with today ?",
    "umm ... yeah ! I ' m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend . Our fifth anniversary ' s next Friday .",
    "Well , I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her . Is there anything particular that you have in mind ?",
    "No , not really ... I ' m completely at a loss .",
    "Well , you can give her a set of pearl earrings , or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant . What is her favorite gemstone ?",
    "That purple one . I ' m sorry ... I ' Ve never bought jewellery for anyone and I ' m kind of nervous .",
    "Don ' t worry , we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed , pressure-free shopping environment . That stone is an amethyst . We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces . Take a look at this bracelet . It ' s 18K rose-gold , studded with amethyst and blue topaz . It ' s a great statement piece .",
    "Oh ... wow . That ' s really pretty . Jess would love that . But ... I was thinking of something a little more delicate , perhaps a necklace ?",
    "We have this beautiful platinum pendant , or you could also get her a locket . You could also get her a timepiece -- it ' s both glamorous yet functional . If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend , maybe I can help you find something for her .",
    "Jess ? Well , she ' s very smart , and has a great sense of humor . She ' s very feminine ...",
    "Perhaps you could give her a ring ?",
    "Well ... actually ... I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me ... I ' Ve just been so nervous .",
    "Well sir , I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose !",
    "Okay , I ' Ve decided . I ' m going to pop the question !",
    "Fabulous ! We should look at engagement rings then ! Now that ' s a whole other section .",
    "Hello , it's nice to meet you .",
    "I'm glad we're meeting today . Thank you .",
    "You're welcome .",
    "I would like to talk to you about your daughter .",
    "Is there a problem ?",
    "No , your daughter is great .",
    "That's great news .",
    "Your daughter is a wonderful student .",
    "She isn't messing up in class ?",
    "Of course not . Your daughter is smart and very well behaved .",
    "Well , I'm so glad to hear that she's doing well .",
    "It is my pleasure to have her in my class .",
    "Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ?",
    "Ryan says he wants to stay . I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ...",
    "No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ?",
    "Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations .",
    "You're not coming ?",
    "Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ?",
    "I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 .",
    "Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ?",
    "We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd .",
    "I'm sorry , Mom .",
    "Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas .",
    "Merry Christmas , Mom . I love you .",
    "I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best .",
    "I know . Goodnight .",
    "Do you have anything to do after this ?",
    "No , I don't .",
    "Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?",
    "That sounds like a good idea .",
    "I know a very interesting place .",
    "Oh , do you ? Good .",
    "Is everything all right ?",
    "Not at all .",
    "What's the problem ?",
    "Someone just robbed me .",
    "What do you mean ?",
    "This guy just robbed me right on the street .",
    "He didn't hurt you , did he ?",
    "I'm okay . He just stole my things .",
    "I'm so sorry .",
    "I have to file a report at the police station .",
    "Let me take you .",
    "I would like that .",
    "Wow , Amy , look at that number .",
    "What's so great about it ?",
    "What do you mean ? It's a scrim .",
    "Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .",
    "I love that kind of stuff .",
    "Yeah , you seem to like those styles .",
    "Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .",
    "This one looks really expensive though .",
    "I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .",
    "Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .",
    "I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .",
    "Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .",
    "Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?",
    "Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .",
    "Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office .",
    "Good morning ! Welcome to our office !",
    "Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams .",
    "Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith .",
    "Today is my first day at work !",
    "Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help .",
    "Thank you . It's very kind of you .",
    "You are welcome .",
    "Hello , is that Cathy speaking ?",
    "Yes , is that you , Allen ?",
    "Yes , how are you doing ?",
    "Not bad .",
    "Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening . Would you like to come with me ?",
    "Sure . Thank you very much .",
    "Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty . OK ?",
    "Ok , see you .",
    "See you .",
    "What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps .",
    "I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .",
    "come on , nothing can be that bad .",
    "but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .",
    "ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?",
    "I've fallen in love with my boss .",
    "really ? Is he married ?",
    "no , of course not . He is still single .",
    "then what's your problem ?",
    "I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .",
    "oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .",
    "worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .",
    "office romance is very tricky .",
    "it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .",
    "cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .",
    "Oh , hey , Keri ! You cook , right ! You're a pretty good cook .",
    "I'm OK .",
    "I want to make an omelet , so actually this is really silly , I've never made one before . How do you make an omelet ?",
    "Well , I can teach you how I make them , which is the same way my father and grandmother make them , which is a little special .",
    "OK . Yeah ! Yeah !",
    "First you take some eggs and crack them in a bowl , and whisk them up , quite , so they're quite high and fluffy , and in a hot pan , and you need a pan that's that's kind of small , that the sides go up at an angle . You put some oil and heat it up , so it's quite hot , and then you take your whipped up eggs , or whisked up eggs , and pour them into the pan , and as it's cooking , if you take a spatula , and push the bottom layer of the egg , to the side , to the sides , and then to the middle , so the uncooked egg gets to the bottom of the pan .",
    "Oh , OK . Wow !",
    "OK . And keep doing that until most of the egg is cooked so you should have a nice thick omelet and then flip it over , you'll only have to cook that side lightly . Put your fillings on the top and fold it over and let it sit just long enough to melt the cheese .",
    "Wow . That sounds really good .",
    "oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people .",
    "Beauty costs , dear ! What do you think of this dress ? Do you think it suits me ?",
    "yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?",
    "come on , you sound like my Mom . Look at that , it's beautiful !",
    "when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .",
    "maybe you have a point .",
    "make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions .",
    "all right . How about this black shirt ? It can be worn for anything---a party , a job interview and even a funeral !",
    "that's true , but you already have two back coats and one black sweater .",
    "oh ! Hey , look , that's the same shirt Britney wore in her concert .",
    "exactly ! Oh , my god ! I love Britney ! I'm going to get it .",
    "why not try it on ?",
    "it's just the right size--a perfect fit ! I'll take it . Oh , no , I'm a little short . Did you bring your credit card ?",
    "yes .",
    "I promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home .",
    "Dai Ling .",
    "Oh , Henry , I haven't seen you for ages . Come in . Let me take your coat . How are you getting along ?",
    "Very well , thank you .",
    "Please take a seat . Everything would be ready in a minute .",
    "Can you bring me a glass of orange juice , please ? I am quite thirsty .",
    "Here you are . Here you go . We have cocktail and salad , fried chicken , French fries and icecream for dessert . Eating chicken while it's hot . it tastes better .",
    "Wow , you're right . Everything is absolutely delicious . Please pass the pepper .",
    "Here you are . Taste the French fries .",
    "They're soft .",
    "Would you like some more ?",
    "No more , thank you .",
    "Here is to our friendship and health !",
    "Bottom is up .",
    "You are from Japan , aren't you ?",
    "Oh , yes !",
    "I love Japan a lot .",
    "I am glad to hear that .",
    "Let's go to another place where my friend is working , let me pay here .",
    "Thank you , I ' ll pay next then .",
    "Oh , I must be going now ; it was nice talking with you .",
    "Check , please .",
    "500 US dollars .",
    "No kidding ! We have only 5 bottles of beer .",
    "You had champagne for the girl .",
    "Can you help me find a nice gift for my young niece ?",
    "Barbie dolls are quite popular , you know .",
    "You're right . Girls love Barbie . Show me a Barbie doll .",
    "Take a look at the newest Barbie -- Digital Barbie .",
    "She's beautiful . What's the price for Digital Barbie ?",
    "Our regular price for Digital Barbie is $ 29 . 95 plus tax .",
    "Only $ 29 . 95 ? I'll buy it , of course .",
    "Another one sold . Do you see anything else you would like ?",
    "Thank you , but no . This will do it for now .",
    "Tax brings your total to $ 32 . 42 . How would you like to pay ?",
    "Cash , please .",
    "Here's your change . Thank you .",
    "Why are you so quiet ?",
    "My girlfriend just broke up with me .",
    "You must feel terrible now .",
    "Yeah .",
    "I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .",
    "You've been through this too ?",
    "Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .",
    "But it hurts too much .",
    "I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .",
    "What if I don't want to find another girl ?",
    "You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .",
    "You're right .",
    "I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?",
    "Yeah . Thanks for the talk .",
    "I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .",
    "Ok . I'll talk to you later .",
    "I really like the way this house looks .",
    "Yes , it has great curb appeal .",
    "The landscaping is wonderful !",
    "Yes , it is nice , but wait until you see the interior .",
    "Oh , I see what you mean !",
    "The carpeting and paint are all new , as well as the window treatments .",
    "I love the sage green carpeting with the sunset-colored walls .",
    "Come and see the kitchen .",
    "Oh , look at that beautiful countertop material and the double sink !",
    "Let ' s go check out the bedroom and bathroom .",
    "I really like the Jacuzzi bathtub in the bathroom .",
    "I am happy that you like the house . We should write down what we like so that we can remember it .",
    "How's the bride-to-be ?",
    "Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .",
    "Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !",
    "I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !",
    "Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .",
    "You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...",
    "I will . Don't worry !",
    "Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 -- let's go !",
    "Hi there , everyone . We hope you're having a good night !",
    "Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win !",
    "The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .",
    "Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be .",
    "But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor !",
    "Is Stanley still singing that Elvis song ? He's really hogging the mic !",
    "If I hear Love Me Tender one more time , I think I'll go crazy !",
    "He sounds like a sick cow !",
    "Can we adjust the pitch a little ? Maybe he'll sound better in a higher key .",
    "I already tried that . Nothing seems to help .",
    "Hey ! Where are you going ... ?",
    "Coing out for a walk .",
    "Why am I being arrested ?",
    "You have a warrant out for your arrest .",
    "I don't have a warrant .",
    "My computer shows that you have a bench warrant .",
    "I don't know what a bench warrant is .",
    "You apparently missed a court appearance .",
    "I was never told to go to court .",
    "There's nothing I can do about that .",
    "This isn't fair .",
    "That's life .",
    "What about my rights ?",
    "Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .",
    "Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific !",
    "Thanks , Jim . I didn ' t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .",
    "No , we just don ' t usually admit it !",
    "Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !",
    "Can you type , Jane ?",
    "Yes , I can .",
    "How many words a minute ?",
    "About 100 words a minute .",
    "En ... and can you speak any foreign languages ?",
    "Yes , I can speak Spanish , and I can also speak Chinese .",
    "Really ? that ' s very good . What about French ?",
    "No , I can ' t speak French . But I can speak Italian , not very well though .",
    "... Can you start next week ?",
    "Next week ?",
    "Yes , on Monday .",
    "You mean I have the job ?",
    "Yes , that ' s right , you have the job now .",
    "Why don't you watch where you're going ?",
    "Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !",
    "There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .",
    "Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in . You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out . And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes . All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .",
    "I think my arm is broken .",
    "Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .",
    "Listen , let's just wait until the police get here . Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .",
    "Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .",
    "I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",
    "Alright .",
    "It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .",
    "Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",
    "Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .",
    "Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",
    "It really hurts .",
    "Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",
    "To hell with you . The accident was your fault .",
    "I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",
    "To hell with you .",
    "Look ! Allen has the mic !",
    "I thought he only liked to listen !",
    "That was before he heard Stanley sing ! I guess he couldn't stand it any more , so he decided to give it a try himself !",
    "( Sound of Allen singing ) Hey , Allen has a really good voice ! He sounds like Johnny Dean !",
    "And he can move . too ! He dances like Ricky Martin !",
    "Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ?",
    "Sure ! What do you feel like having ?",
    "I really feel like having a big juicy steak !",
    "Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?",
    "I didn't know you were a vegetarian !",
    "I'm not , I am a vegan .",
    "A what ?",
    "A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .",
    "Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !",
    "It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .",
    "Hey , how was the show ?",
    "Not great . It's a kind of boring .",
    "Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .",
    "Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .",
    "we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ?",
    "yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !",
    "let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?",
    "what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?",
    "I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .",
    "well , let's get a plate of those then .",
    "sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?",
    "I think I might have a dahl .",
    "what's in a dahl ?",
    "it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .",
    "that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?",
    "ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?",
    "that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?",
    "I think I'll have a beer .",
    "ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?",
    "I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .",
    "you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !",
    "what would you do without me ?",
    "Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox .",
    "I ' m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .",
    "I don ' t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?",
    "Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .",
    "But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation .",
    "I know why we have reservations .",
    "I don ' t think you do . If you did , I ' d have a car . See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .",
    "But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like .",
    "Fine . I ' ll take the compact .",
    "Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?",
    "Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .",
    "Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it .",
    "It is called Energy Collector .",
    "Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ?",
    "Maybe . Oh , I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting .",
    "I want to have a try later .",
    "Me too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ?",
    "Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky .",
    "Good , you can make your dream come true here .",
    "Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House .",
    "So you can prove you are a man .",
    "Bingo !",
    "It's just you !",
    "Hi Paul . How are you , friend .",
    "Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall .",
    "How so ?",
    "He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .",
    "Have you talk to him about it ?",
    "Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night",
    "Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .",
    "This is no laughing matter , Nick .",
    "Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?",
    "He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .",
    "Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?",
    "Welcome , how may I help you today ?",
    "I'm ask for a pizza , please .",
    "Then you will be happy to hear that today all our pizzas are on sale . Two for one .",
    "You're right , that is great .",
    "What size would you like ?",
    "Medium one will be perfect , thank you",
    "Which kind do you want ?",
    "I like seafood on my pizza .",
    "We have two seafood pizzas . Tuna and crab .",
    "Tuna sounds good today .",
    "Would that be for here or take away ?",
    "That would be to go .",
    "That'll be in a ten minutes . Please sit over there , and I'll call you over as sooner as it's ready .",
    "No problem .",
    "The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down .",
    "What ' s up ?",
    "Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday .",
    "Anything that distracts you from work ?",
    "Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ' t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ' t manage my time well . I can ' t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things .",
    "Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ' s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ' t push yourself too hard , ok ?",
    "Well , I will try .",
    "How are you , Sue ?",
    "Pretty good . I ' Ve just had my new poems published .",
    "Congratulations on your success .",
    "Thank you .",
    "And how ' s your brother ?",
    "He is fine .",
    "He ' s going to be sent to Britain to study , really ?",
    "Yes . He ' s already got the passport and visa .",
    "Fantastic ! Please send him my congratulations .",
    "Thank you . He ' s very lucky indeed .",
    "Wow , the ferris wheel over there is so big . I'd like to take a ride on it .",
    "It is called Energy Collector .",
    "Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ?",
    "Maybe . Oh . I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting .",
    "I want to have a try later .",
    "Me , too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ?",
    "Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky .",
    "Good , you can make your dream come true here .",
    "Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House .",
    "So you can prove you are a man .",
    "Bingo !",
    "It's just you !",
    "Lee , I'm going to get married next month .",
    "Good news ! And congratulations !",
    "You are invited to my wedding .",
    "Thank you . I'll certainly be there .",
    "Would you like to see our new shirts ?",
    "Sorry , but I'm not really that interested in those things .",
    "Well , they are very nice you know .",
    "Really ?",
    "And not expensive either .",
    "Oh , I don't care about that .",
    "Everybody is buying them .",
    "Are they ?",
    "Yes , they are very fashionable , you see .",
    "I am afraid I am not interested in fashion .",
    "I see .",
    "But thank you very much all the same .",
    "Sorry I couldn't help you .",
    "Ms Anderson , my name is Mike . I am Division Chief of ABC Company . Welcome to Toronto .",
    "Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you .",
    "A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you .",
    "Thank you , they are beautiful .",
    "I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side . Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?",
    "Alright .",
    "It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .",
    "Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .",
    "Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .",
    "Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .",
    "It really hurts .",
    "Yes , maybe it does . But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?",
    "To hell with you . The accident was your fault .",
    "I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone . Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?",
    "To hell with you .",
    "Could I have some fish ?",
    "Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ?",
    "Oh , spinach , I think .",
    "Fine , And what about something to drink ?",
    "Just a beer , please .",
    "Good . Thank you . sir .",
    "Would you like to have some more beer ?",
    "No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please .",
    "Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .",
    "Thank you .",
    "Hello , sir , what can I do for you today ?",
    "Hello , I need a new suit . I have an important interview next week , so I really need to look sharp .",
    "No problem ! We have a broad selection of suits , all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly .",
    "Great ! I want a three piece suit , preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool .",
    "Very well sir . Would you like to have some shirts made also ?",
    "Sure . I ' ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties .",
    "Very good . Now , if you will accompany me , we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts .",
    "Hi , Dan . What's new ?",
    "Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .",
    "I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?",
    "I got fired .",
    "How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?",
    "It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .",
    "What are you going to do now ?",
    "I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .",
    "That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?",
    "Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .",
    "Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .",
    "I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .",
    "Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one .",
    "Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .",
    "Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .",
    "I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .",
    "Diane Grant ? I haven't seen you for ages !",
    "Brian ! How have you been ?",
    "Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !",
    "Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .",
    "Well , you look great ! How are you ?",
    "I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .",
    "That's terrific !",
    "I am really interested in buying this television .",
    "That's so great !",
    "How much are you selling it for ?",
    "This t . v is only $ 2500 .",
    "You can't be serious .",
    "That's how much this t . v costs .",
    "That's too expensive for me .",
    "This television is of very high quality .",
    "You can't go down on the price .",
    "By how much ?",
    "I'll buy it for $ 2000 .",
    "I'm sorry , but the price is final .",
    "Lily , can you take part in our picnic this weekend ?",
    "That sounds great . Where are you going ?",
    "I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .",
    "What should I bring ?",
    "Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything .",
    "Are you finished ?",
    "Yes . May I have some more beer ?",
    "Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute . Thank you for waiting . Here it is . Did you enjoy your meal ?",
    "Yes , the meal was very delicious and I enjoyed very much . I'm full .",
    "Is that so ? I'm glad you enjoyed it .",
    "By the way , Miss . Where is the toilet ?",
    "Toilets are in the rear . I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .",
    "What ?",
    "Hi , Monica , how is everything going ?",
    "Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .",
    "Why ? You ' re not satisfied anymore ?",
    "I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .",
    "That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .",
    "Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .",
    "Ok , good luck to you .",
    "that was a really good meal , Gordon .",
    "It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .",
    "well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .",
    "you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .",
    "let's see how much the bill is .",
    "don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .",
    "what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .",
    "no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .",
    "no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .",
    "alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .",
    "that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .",
    "just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?",
    "you've got a deal .",
    "great . Bye .",
    "bye .",
    "Nice to see you , Patrick .",
    "Bob ! I hear your team won the match .",
    "Yeah . All of us tried our best .",
    "Congratulations !",
    "Hi , Tina , I ' Ve got good news . I have successfully passed the first two rounds of interview with ABC Company . They informed me to go to the final round next Monday . It looks very promising .",
    "That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .",
    "Thanks . Let ' s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?",
    "Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?",
    "No problem . See you !",
    "See you !",
    "Why don't you watch where you're going ?",
    "Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !",
    "There was plenty of room for me to pull out . You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .",

    "To hell with you .",
    "Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here .",
    "Just kids like that .",
    "Come on baby , stop trying to pretend like a man . If you go there , you are sure to like them .",
    "Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there !",
    "I said you are sure to like them . There is the Grand Parade Of Ants Carnival in a few minutes in the square . You will experience a dream of fantasy .",
    "What's that ?",
    "All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom .",
    "That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ?",
    "I thought you had grown out of such child practices .",
    "Cut it out . Look at my smile , and it seems like the flowers in the spring . Right ?",
    "Gross !",
    "Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face .",
    "Stupid girl , making me spend so much money , now I have to get it from the ATM ...",
    "Hello , welcome to Universal Bank . Please insert your card into the slot .",
    "I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ' m an idiot ...",
    "Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the pound key . Thank you . Please select an option . Thank you . You have selected withdrawal .",
    "Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just give me my money !",
    "Please type the amount you would like to withdraw . Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 .",
    "No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No !",
    "Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye !",
    "What do you think of this one ?",
    "Eh , so so .",
    "And this one ? Too flashy ?",
    "Nah , not too flashy .",
    "Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?",
    "I guess .",
    "Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .",
    "And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !",
    "Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !",
    "Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !",
    "Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !",
    "Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?",
    "I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !",
    "Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ?",
    "Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now .",
    "Wow . You look great .",
    "Thanks for noticing .",
    "What type of diet were you on ?",
    "I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months .",
    "That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ?",
    "Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day .",
    "That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ?",
    "Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate .",
    "That makes sense . I'm going to try that .",
    "You don't need to lose weight .",
    "I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of .",
    "Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet .",
    "Thanks for the advice .",
    "No problem .",
    "Something ' s burning ?",
    "Oh , my bread !",
    "Mm , I love burnt bread .",
    "Curse this oven ! Curse it !",
    "But I prefer burnt bread .",
    "Curse the worst oven in the world .",
    "Wonderful ! A perfect piece of bread !",
    "There are thirteen of them . Oh , have another . Have a third , if you like , have them all .",
    "Hello , Bessie .",
    "Hello , Jack . Happy birthday !",
    "My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .",
    "I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .",
    "Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .",
    "Now let me sing \" Happy birthday \" for you .",
    "Thank you very much .",
    "I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter .",
    "Would she be interested in a laptop ?",
    "That's exactly what I was thinking of .",
    "A Mac would be an excellent gift .",
    "I like Macs . How much for a Mac ?",
    "You can take a 15 - inch Pro home right now for only $ 2,100 .",
    "A Mac it is . I'll take one home with me .",
    "She'll be very happy with this . And how do you plan to pay for it ?",
    "I'll use my VISA , if that's okay .",
    "Now , if you'll just sign here , the Mac is all yours .",
    "Will she need anything besides what's in this box ?",
    "Everything she needs is right here in the box .",
    "I appreciate your help . Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff .",

    "Mary , could you please come in for a short while ?",
    "No problem .",
    "Mary , I'd like you to meet Richard , Our new executive in the marketing .",
    "Nice to meet you , Austin .",
    "Welcome to our department . I hope you'll like it here .",
    "By the way , Richard will assist me in the planning work . I hope you can work well together .",
    "Sure , if you've got any problem you can ask me .",
    "Thank you . It ' s very kind of you .",
    "Richard , Mary is a very helpful and experienced secretary indeed , and I'm sure you will find out .",
    "Thank you , sir . I'll try my best to assist Richard in his work .",
    "Hello !",
    "Hello , Is that Stefan ?",
    "I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number . There is no Stefan here .",
    "Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there .",
    "Yes . I'm sure . You have the wrong number . I have used this number for more than 20 years .",
    "That can't be true . I remember the number clearly . Is your number 1199886 ?",
    "No , it isn't . It's 1199866 . It seems that you have misdialed .",
    "Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry .",
    "It doesn't matter . It happens to everyone .",
    "Sorry again for bothering you .",
    "That's all right .",
    "Hi , Jack , how have you been ?",
    "Not very well .",
    "Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?",
    "Nothing .",
    "Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .",
    "Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .",
    "Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .",
    "Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .",
    "Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .",
    "Maybe you're right .",
    "Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !",
    "Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ...",
    "How about this floor lamp ?",
    "Fine , just get it ! We have been shopping for furniture for five hours ! I ' m so tired !",
    "We still need to find an armoire and a dresser .",
    "Fine ! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand , coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things .",
    "Great ! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I ' ll also get a bean bag and a dining set .",
    "While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner ? I really want one so I can watch TV .",
    "Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ' t think so !",

    "Recliner ? In my beautifully decorated living room ? I don ' t think so !",
    "What ' s wrong with you ? Why are you scratching so much ?",
    "I feel itchy ! I can ' t stand it anymore ! I think I may be coming down with something . I feel lightheaded and weak .",
    "Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me !",
    "What ' s wrong ?",
    "I think you have chicken pox ! You are contagious ! Get away ! Don ' t breathe on me !",
    "Maybe it ' s just a rash or an allergy ! We can ' t be sure until I see a doctor .",
    "Well in the meantime you are a biohazard ! I didn ' t get it when I was a kid and I ' Ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult !",
    "Are you serious ? You always blow things out of proportion . In any case , I think I ' ll go take an oatmeal bath .",
    "What are you going to do next year ?",
    "I want to go traveling .",
    "Do you have any where in mind ?",
    "Yes , I've been thinking about Florida .",
    "Hello , thanks for calling 123 Tech Help , I ' m Todd . How can I help you ?",
    "Hello ? Can you help me ? My computer ! Oh man ...",
    "It ' s okay sir , calm down . What happened ?",
    "I turned on my laptop and it broke ! I mean , the monitor went black !",
    "Ok , sir , it sounds like you might have a virus .",
    "I don ' t feel sick , ... let me check ... Nope ! No fever , I ' m fine .",
    "No , your computer might have a virus , I mean , it has a bad program on it . Maybe that ' s why it crashed . I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans .",
    "Phew ! . . . Wait a minute , CRASH ? ? ! ! Spyware ? Trojans ! What ? where ? when ? !",
    "guess what ? I've got great news !",
    "what is it ?",
    "well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?",
    "yes .",
    "well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .",
    "really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?",
    "she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .",
    "wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?",
    "it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .",
    "are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?",
    "yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !",
    "do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?",
    "I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .",
    "I'm really looking forward to reading your column .",
    "me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?",
    "sure , where would you like to go ?",
    "perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .",
    "Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !",
    "I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !",
    "But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !",
    "Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !",
    "What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?",
    "Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !",
    "So he talks about you behind your back ?",
    "Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !",
    "I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .",
    "I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .",
    "My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .",
    "Did you hear who won the election ?",
    "I can ' t believe that Obama won .",

    "What a nice day !",
    "yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?",
    "great , let's go !",
    "hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .",
    "exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...",
    "yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !",
    "why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .",
    "are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?",
    "never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?",
    "yeah , I think so .",
    "ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .",

    "But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ...",
    "I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .",
    "This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone .",
    "I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock .",
    "The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that .",
    "Very glad to know something about you , then what are you going to do when you finish .",
    "Oh , I ' ll go to shanghai to practice there .",
    "That ' s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .",
    "I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .",
    "And English is very useful in your job .",
    "I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life .",
    "You will be a very promising one .",
    "That ' s my wish .",
    "Hello , is Marie Ward there , please ?",
